<p> All the peoples over the world are struggling financial, others know how to become rich with no money others too does not. This makes those with no such ideas to become rich very poor. It is not because they are not willing to work hard. The true fact is they don’t know the road to wealth. And yes, won’t you get lost, if you are going to a place and you don’t know the way? </p>
<p> Indeed you will and the same principles implies in building wealth. If you don’t know how the money is accumulated how are you going to make it? “Lack of knowledge my people perish” In this world there is a way of doing everything, the fact that you are not making it does not mean you can’t. No, you are just doing it wrongly, you need to outsource how it really works and do it that way. </p>
<p> What do you think of becoming rich and successful, is there no way? There is, you just need to search for such tips. How to live a successful live is not what am going to talk about. </p>

<h3 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 1. Start Investing Early </h3>
<p> Investment is the best way of building great wealth but it requires a huge capital before you can make money with it. So the best way to do it is to start investing early with small money no matter how much you earn. You don’t have to wait before you had enough money to begin investing no. The earlier you start is the best. </p>
 <p> Let say you are earning $50 monthly you can decide to put aside $10 monthly into and investment fund. In 10 years’ time this will be $1200 and do you know you can make a big interest monthly with $1200 by investing it? Yes, that is how wealth is accumulated, first in small sums, one lesson I learn earlier about finance is that “wealth does not come to a man who does not put aside a certain percentage of what he earns” </p>
<p> That is one way of becoming rich with no or little money. Put aside any little money you earn into investment or savings account and later invest it. When it become huge you can invest this money for high interest. There are so many sources you can invest your money in later on including businesses, buying stocks, shares, treasury bills. But before you get into any investment make sure you know what you are doing before you end up losing all your money. </p>
<p> Ok let move on to the next tip I want to show you… </p>

2.	Learn a High Paying Skill </h3>
<p> I think this is the far most simplest way if you want to know how to become rich with no money. Most people who started with nothing, I mean real street hustlers with no money have made a fortune with it. We all know of Peter biz the sales writer of Amazon. What makes Peter so rich is high income skill “copywriting” He started with nothing in life. When he was interviewed on the TV what he said was “I was selling news papers on the street” </p>
<p> Yes he was selling news papers on the street but now look at how wealthy he is due to his high income skill. So master a high income skill and keep working on it your fortune is yet to come. There are so many high income skills out there including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Copywriting</li>
<li>	Computer programming</li>
<li>	Graphic Designing</li>
<li>	Marketing </li>
<li>	SEO content writing</li>
</ul>
<p> There are a lot that I couldn’t include so look for what you are interest in build a career in it. </p> <h3 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">
3.	Invent Something New </h3>
<p> Am sure you know of Elon Musk right? He is known as one of the greatest inventor in the world. Introducing something new into the world does not require you to have a wealthy background. All you need is the mindset to make things happen. Warren Buffet once said “You will dream by all means, so why don’t you dream big” </p>
<p> Yes I know you are not a genius but Buffet quote does make sense a lot. Some peoples are afraid of dreaming big, and what Buffet is trying to say is instead of making small dreams and achieve something small why don’t you make dreams and achieve something big. </p>
<p> I hope you get the concept in it. If you care about making the world a better place you have to dream big. Dreaming big and achieving it is a great way of becoming rich with no money. You don’t need any capital to start because those are your normal dreams that you are working on. But when you are finally done on such dream it becomes a new invention to the world. </p>
<p> So have the guts to dream big and the riches will follow. </p>
<p> We are getting to the best tips on this list.
<p> But there is one “Powerful” hack I want to show you… </p>

4.	Take Risk </h3>
<p> A lot of people with little money had made a great fortune in taking risk. We know of Zack Bezos the 3* lottery winner. Zack was rank 19th among the richest men in the world in 2004. He made his first win with only $20 lottery ticket. Then he got higher one later on. According to forbs this man was just a poor farm boy who was selling vegetables on the street before he made his fortune. </p>
<p> This does not mean you should involve yourself in any risk, no. Just because you hear me saying Zack had made a fortune in it does not mean you should run into the casino and put all your savings on bet.  There are clean risk that you that you can become wealthy quick with it. Some like buying lottery ticket and investing. </p>
<p> Hey did you said investing? </p>
<p> Yes, that is exactly what I said. Most people think investing is not a risk but let me tell you. If you invest your money unwisely anywhere you will regret in your life, trust me. It has happened to me before so I know what am talking about. Most people thinks investment is something you can just put your money in and be waiting for the interest to be falling in your bank account. No, it does work that way only if you invest wisely. But if you don’t your principal will not even come back to your account. </p>
<p> So in short all what am trying to show you is take risk but do it wisely. If you are with no or little money then consider taking risk in games that require little money like the casino and lottery ticket. </p>
<p> Ok moving on to the next hack. </p>
<p> If you really want to know how to become rich with no money there is one thing you need to do now… </p>

5.	Associate With Rich People </h3>
<p> You have probably heard that “your network is your net wealth” Most people are success today not just because their very hard working or they have a great mindset which you don’t know. Their network made them rich. You don’t have to build a network with anyone but rather associate with rich peoples you can learn from. </p>
<p> They will teach and advise you on what you should do to become like them. The journey to a successful life is a tough road and if you don’t have anyone who can accompany you it becomes overwhelming. What do you think is the reason for most people to seek mentorship? They knew they can’t make it alone and yes they do need help from someone who has already made it. </p>
<p> Today the internet has made things very easy for us. You can connect with most rich and successful people online. LinkedIn is the best platform to connect with most successful people. You don’t have to bombard for help immediately you connect with them no. Focus on one or two peoples and build a slow friendship with them. When the bond between you and them become tight, there you should start asking them for advice and help. </p>
<p> But remember of this golden rule that my granny gave me “Advise is something that is freely given. But always see to it that you take the one that is wealth having” You know in this world there are only two peoples “Bad and good” yes the fact that you know someone to be successful does not mean you know his character too. </p>
<p> Other successful people are very greedy and never want anyone to become like them. When you ask such people for advice they will bombard you with words you might believe in. But in reality their just putting you on the other side of the game. Yes that is how greedy others are so you need to be careful and make a lot of research about any advice you have been told before you go ahead and apply it. </p>
<p> As I said there are good peoples and bad ones. The good ones are not greedy and their interest in the success of everyone. Those are the kind of peoples you should build a network with. Such people if you send them a mail it does not take long for them to reply. But the greedy ones they pretend to be busy all the time. I discovered this when I began building network with most successful peoples in my community. </p>
<p> So you do need to be careful not to build a network with someone who will drag you to the other side of the game. </p>
<p> Okay, We are getting close to the best hacks on this list. </p>
<p> But you do need to check this magic tip… </p>

6.	Avoid Impressing Others </h3>
<p> When I was in college, because I was poor with only three trousers in the dormitory. All what I was doing was wash and wear. Yes you heard it “Wash and wear” I know you know what am talking of? This is common thing to all the poor guys out there. What it actually means is. You just wash a dress and wear it without waiting it to dry. If you have done this before comment bellow so that I will know am in a team with you. </p>
<p> I didn’t care about impressing anyone or dressing to attract the beautiful girl in the class, no. I was just living according to my own means “Cut your coat according to your shirt” </p>
<p> But most of my mate whom parent were rich what were they doing? Their wee bringing new dresses to lectures all the time whiles I could wear a single trouser for a week. I didn’t spend any money on dress, neither did I on food. I was just enjoying cheap things. </p>
<p> So imagine because I saw my mate changing dresses all the time and if I would have done the same with my fees. Do you think I would me being a poor guy would have been able to complete school? No, why because for them when they wastes any money now they will get it back from their parent the next day. But what of me?  </p>
<p> So you have to live your live as a poor person and stop impressing others by buying unnecessary things. Wasting money just to impress others is not a wise move you should take. At the end you will not incur anything better than expenses. </p>
<p> This is something I found it very hard for ladies to get rid of. Ladies like showing themselves a lot to others to know that they also have a cute body. They don’t mind they will buy the latest lipstick that cost the total price equal to their bank account balance. Yes I know a friend who is of this type, despite the fact that she is from rich family she doesn’t care buying latest stuff jus to impress guys. </p>
<p> This is a bad habit you must get rid of especially if you are poor. You might think you becoming famous in others eyes but you won’t know you are just digging a poverty hole for yourself. What does it mean for others to know you as a rich person whiles in reality you are poor with $ -100,000 in your bank account balance? What I mean by $-100,000 here is debt. So you see it doesn’t make any sense. </p>
<p> So live according to your own means and stop buying unnecessary expensive things just to impress others. </p>
<p> It is the moment you have being for. </p>
<p> The best hack of becoming with no money that nobody talks about… </p>

7.	Stop Wasting your Time on Things that Will Never make you Rich </h3>
<p> You have probably heard of this “Your comfort zone is your poverty zone” you need to stop doing things that you are comfortable with that will not make you rich. The law to achieve a successful life is to work on your dreams. But do you think if you are wasting your time on unnecessary things that does not correlate to your dreams you will become rich? </p>
<p> No, something good must come out form all what you are waste time on daily. So each and every blessed day ask yourself this “Will what am doing now make me rich in the future?” If you get a no response from your mind you have to stop doing it quickly. You need to focus most of your time on things that will make you rich. If you have dreams to achieve why don’t you spend 80% of your time working on it daily? </p>
<p> Just look at this saying “We are paid by the value we put in not the time” So if you have goals and you don’t put in much value you can’t achieve anything good. And yes you can pretend to be wasting time on your dreams doing nothing just because you hear me saying you should wastes time on your dreams.  I don’t mean that if you have an article to write today, ON your laptop and put your head on the table and sleep, no. What I mean is put in more value on your goals, remember at the end you will be paid by the value you put in not the time you wastes on. </p>
<p> In life you may waste time no matter what. But if you want to become rich quick then you should waste most of your time on things that will help you to achieve such aim. The fact that you are busy all day does not mean you are being productive on your goals no. If you keep wasting time on unnecessary stuff then I have one question for you. When will you start working on those your goals that will make you rich? So put in much effort and waste most of your time working on your dreams. </p>
<p> Alright finally we are getting to the last part on how to become rich with no money. </p>
<p> But remember if you want to become rich, famous and successful fast then you must... </p>

8.	Invest in yourself </h3>
<p> They say investment in knowledge pays the best interest. But what do you think of the kind of payment you will get by investing in yourself? If you answered success, wealth or fame then you are right. Most successful people today in high paying jobs invested in their self by paying school fees themselves. Just imagine you want to become a computer programmer or a graphic designer but yet for a single laptop for studies you are not willing to buy. </p>
<p> How are you going to succeed in this career? So invest in yourself and focus on whatever you are doing don’t quit.  Your peers are investing in themselves by taking online courses about their career and many more. You don’t have to be a stand by and watch them becoming successful no you need to do the same. And remember there will be a result for anything that you are doing right now. </p>
<p> So if there is anything that you want to put in much effort then consider investing in yourself. I personally never knew the value of investing in one’s self until I read a book in some library and found out that is really beneficial. So since then I have done all my possible best to invest in myself very well.

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> Final thought on how to become rich with no money 
</h2>
<p> As you know nobody had ever become rich or successful in life so easy. If it was to be easy I don’t think you would have been seeing poor people on the street side begging for money day and night. So you need to courageous  and focus, keep working on your goals and never give up. It is not easy that is why most people aren’t able to make it but tell yourself that “I just don’t quite I will make my dreams come true and until and until am done I will never quite” </p>
<p> Saying such affirmation words to yourself on regular basis will remind you that you have an important task in life. Also continuous saying of such words to yourself daily will convert into a habit. We all know of the famous boxer Ali Muhammad whenever he is in the ring he will say to himself “Am the greatest no one can defeat me” he will say this to himself several times until the match is end. And yes due to the power of such affirmation whenever his mind hears it his spirit rise even though he is down. That is why he had won almost 95% of all his matches in his boxing career. </p>
