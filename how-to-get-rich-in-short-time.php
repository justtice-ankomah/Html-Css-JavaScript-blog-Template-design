<p>If you weren’t then that was what I was told.  But do you know the reason why my parent told me this? Is because they have failed many times in it and they don’t want me to lose money in. But there is one thing my parents don’t know of, and that is the main rule regards to gambling (Gamble with your spare money only).   </p>

<p>There are a lot of successful people today who never worked hard but made their fortune through gambling. We all know of Zack Branson the man who made his fortune in lottery ticket. Do you think if he would have stop buying lottery ticket when he first loose would he have gotten to where he is now? Off course no, when he was interviewed what he said was “I always buy lottery tickets with my spare money so if I lose it doesn’t affect me” </p>
<p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">
2. Buy an Existing Business</h2>
<p>Your chance of failing with a fresh start up business is much higher due to high competitions among your competitors. So if you want to become rich quick in business, the best option is to buy and existing business which is already on a growing stage. </p>
<p>Off cause the price of busying a growing business will be much higher than starting your own from scratch. But there is an advantage: </p>
<li> Who knows starting a business from scratch might fail or not. So the best option is to top up your money and buy and existing business even if the price is much higher than you may be expecting. </li>
<li> The other advantage is that the moment you buy a growing business, you will begin profiting from it without waiting for long time. Why because such business is already growing and is on the stage of making more money.</li>
<li> Branding: do you know branding is an important aspect in business operation? Well, if you don’t know here is a quick example. Imagine a startup business who nobody knows of competing with coca cola. How is it like, can it survives? Surely no, unless such business establishes a high branding authority before it can gain popularity over coca cola.</li>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">
3.	Become Rich By Inheritance</h2>
<p>Are you from a royal house or are your parents or grannies super rich? </p>
<p>Then don’t worry that much okay. There is going to be some honey that will fall into your mouth someday, just keep waiting for it. Inheritance is the best way of becoming rich quick that most people don’t know of. Example</p>
<p>I have a friend called Bernard who is currently an owner of two banks in my country.  During our childhood days Ben and I were the poorest kids in the class. Bens parent were very poor just as mine. But there was one thing Ben never knew of. His grannies were super rich but all those past days Ben never knew of it. They had a lot of companies and behold their life’s was good. </p>
<p>But due to some quarrel between Ben’s parent and the grannies they never thought they could have their own share of such wealth when the grannies die. But when Ben got to 17 years something strange happened. The grannies died and their wealth was passed on to Ben’s Father. So guess what, do you think their life will remain the safe? </p>
<p>No, their success began from there. Because Ben was the only son, all those companies and the investment were passed on to him when the parent died in a car accident. By then he was only 22 years and despite the fact that his parent are gone he won’t have to suffer anymore. </p>

<p>Then lift up your hand in the air and shout boom, boom I have landed on the right place. Yes, you’re definitely, but there is one problem, am not here to hand over my sister or brother to you for marriage.  No, am really sorry bro you have to look for someone else. </p>
<p>What I want to show you is a magic hack that will make you rich by marrying a millionaire partner. </p>
<p>I know others will tell you to go for a respectful man or woman who will treat you well even if he or she is poor. This is a very good advice; we all want to have partners who will be with us no matter what right? </p>
<p>Wrong. </p>
<p>Let me tell you, if you get married and there is no money in the family, my brother or sister, the way you will suffer eh. Hmm I don’t even know the kind of device I will use to measure the length of your suffering. Is true they say “money is not everything” but there is one thing the person who came up with this quote don’t know and that is “Everything needs money” </p>

In my community here, there is one rich man who owns a lot of business. But will you agree with me if I tell you that he is well respected than the king here? Well, if you don’t believe it come and see it with your own eyes. </p>
<p>So in short all what am trying to say is. Whiles others will tell you to marry a respectful partner, I will advise you to take your time and look for a respectful partner who is also rich. Such peoples don’t come easy and their very hard to find but remember “anything that is wealthy doesn’t come easily” </p>

5.	Get into Online Trading to get rich quick</h2>
<p>Have you heard of bit coin mining or crypto currency? </p>
<p>I never knew of this until a friend told me about it. The first time I head of it I thought it was a scam. While there is other activities considered as scam about online trading. Buying bit coin and selling it is not a scam if you think it is. I personally test everything out before I share with you. Would you believe if I tell you I was able to make $100 profit in just 1 hour in my first day of trading bit coin? </p>
<p>Yes I did, but I couldn’t do it all alone I have a friend who has been into bit coin trading for a long time. He has a lot of experience in it so he thought me how I can buy coins and sell them high to others in a short time. His trick was that, he has two platform of trading. The price of bit coin on the first platform is much higher than the other. </p>
<p>So what he do was buying it low from the second platform and selling it high at the first platform. I think I have to write a full article about this and show you all the platforms and some simple tips to get your bit coin sold easily. Yes, I have a pending article about making more money but when am done with that I will show you those tips. So make sure you subscribe with your email by navigating the home page of this site. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a quick way of becoming rich then you really need to get into online trading. But make sure you join scam free platforms like bit coin and crypto currency.

For the past 3 month that I got into this trading I have made almost $100,000 in it. </p>
<p>It simple you just need a pro who is already into it to teach you what you need to do. </p>

<p>But before we get to it let make some quick money by…</p>
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">
6.	Investing In Real Estate </h2>
<p>Real estate is a booming business now days. Almost all my friends seem to be investing in it. </p>
<p>Do you know why? </p>
<p>Is a quick way for all those who want to know how to get rich in short time with some capital. </p>
<p>People will always rent month after month so such business will stay with us for all generations. One advantage is that is super-fast. If you are a serious marketer who is into real estate you can buy a house today and in the evening rent it or sell it high to another person. Yes, that is what other serious marketers are doing. When they get their hand on a house it doesn’t take them even two days to get it sold to another person. </p>
<p>This does not mean you need to have a college degree in marketing before you can get into it, no. All what you need is a little capital and a small knowledge of marketing or sales. The best part about real estate is that, it serves as a passive income when you rent out a house to a tenant. Because renting is done on monthly bases, you will cash in a certain percentage every month without doing any hard work. </p>
<p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
</p>
<p>So get into such business if your aim is to become rich quick and you have some capital. If you don’t have any capital but you still want to get into it then go for loan. You don’t have to become successful all the time with your own money. You can use other people’s money to become rich, we all know of Robert Kiyosaki the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad”. He is rich today not because he had a huge capital, no. He was using others people’s money in doing real estate business. </p>
<p>So you can also do the same but as for knowledge about real estate investing. There are thousands of books out there you can learn from. </p>

<p>Do you know what makes it special?

7.	Have Multiple Stream Of Income</h2>
<p>If you live pay check to pay check with your current job, you will never become rich. </p>
<p>The purpose of working is to convert that pay check earnings into passive income. But if at the end of the month you get nothing to save. Then tell me what are you going to convert into passive income? </p>
<p>So you see, you really need to have a second source of income so that each month you can get something to save. The best way to do this is to look for part time job if your current job allows you to have much time. If not then you need to quit your job and go for one that pays high. You can also start a side business or own an online business. For online the quick way I will suggest for you is to create a <a href="youtube.com" >YouTube </a>channel or get into affiliate marketing. </p>
<p>YouTube is highly paying after getting your first 1000 subscribers. And with affiliate marketing too whenever you refer someone to purchase a certain product, you will have your share of the product sold. </p>

Final thought on How to Get Rich in Short Time</h2>
<p>Those are all proven ways on how to get rich in short time. But remember what I always advise you on (Get The Action Habit). You do remember I told you I have been making over $500,000 in bit coin trading right? </p>

<p>That is not what I said, $100,000 is what I have made so far. But do you think if I would have not taken any action, could I have been able to make this money? </p>
<p>No, so get the action habit and implement any of the above tips you wish to get into. </p>
