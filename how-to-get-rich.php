<p>This question, how to get rich, is the most searchable question over the internet and hence there are a lot of suggestions on it but the problem, how will you know the proven ones that actually work. It is well known that others talk without researching so it shouldn’t surprise you if am to tell you that not all the answers on the internet to some questions are right. But concerning wealth building here is the right source for all your answers.</p>



<p>Everyone wants to become rich and yes you also want to that’s why you are here right. No one wants to be a poor person in future but rather to be counted among the rich peoples, and yes that is the way it should be.</p>



<p>Poverty is evil and you should do all your possible best to eliminate it in your life if you are already in it. But is all about money and perhaps you will ask me that:</p>



<p>Hey I don’t have money how can I eliminate poverty in my life and become or get rich in the future?</p>

<p>Well don’t you worry that is the main reason why I wrote this article, and is the best proven ways of acquiring or building wealth that I have tested it myself. </p>

<p>Success does not happen overnight it does require action before; this is one thing most people don’t actually understand. Everyone wants to wake up one day and see billions of money in his or her bank account without he or she doing any form of work.</p>

<P> No my brother or sister it doesn’t happen that way and it will never unless by miracle or luck. Besides all the successful people that you have been hearing of, all put in some effort before they got to where they are today, they paid the price, they had a burning desire for getting rich, and they set plans and focused on it.</p>



<p>So won’t it be wise for you to practice what they did in the past so that you can also become or get rich in the future?</p>



<p>Well it will be a good start. But the problem is most of these people encounters a lot of failure and did a lot of mistakes which they wish if they are to start all over again they would have done it in a different way. </p>

<p>And that is what below proven ideas will teach you, you don’t have to repeat the same mistakes that they did. To name a few, most of them started investing in places where they knew nothing about and later ended up losing all their money, not drawing proper budget and many more.</p>



<p>So check on below proven ideas, I will recommend that you pay attention to each step very well.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1. <strong>Get A Job ( 1<sup>st</sup> approach on how to get rich )</strong></h2>



<p>Can you Dream without sleeping? Possible no, and the same thing applies in money making or building wealth. <br><br> You need to have something to achieve something, so if you are not working or doing any form of business which does not gives you some amount of money monthly, then don’t be standing there idle and be hoping that a miracle will come no. This is the right time, you need to go out and look for job.</p>



<p>A lot of people are naturally lazy in life and the same people dream of getting rich or becoming successful in the future. But they take no action into building wealth that will guarantee them success in the coming future.<br><br> Don’t be like these people and if you have friends who are like these don’t associate with them much because those are the upcoming poor people. The purpose of job is not to be doing it for your entire life but to be able to convert those earnings into passive income so that it can grow and continue paying you.</p>



<p>There are so many kinds of work you can do today to become or get rich in the future by working online or offline jobs.<br><br> But for offline works I actually don’t know the skills you have now because most jobs do require skills. But if you are with no skills and you really want to get into money making by working offline consider these jobs base on your gender:</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2. <strong>Pay Yourself First ( Easy way on how to get rich )</strong></h2>
<img src="img/blog-img/pay yourself first.webp" alt="How to Get Rich" title="How to Get Rich" style="float:left;padding:10px;">


<p>&nbsp;Yes, this will be your breakthrough, “pay yourself first in all your earnings “A lot of people claim they know how to become or get rich but they always forget about this approach which all success people use.</p>



<p>But answer these:</p>



<p>Don’t you pay the food sellers when you buy food?</p>



<p>Don’t you pay the government for electricity?</p>



<p>Don’t you pay the garment -maker for cloth?</p>



<p>Can you live in this world without spending?</p>



<p>Of course, No, you can’t live in this world without spending.</p>



<p>Can you see the difference here?</p>



<p>You have been paying to these peoples with all your previous earnings and hence making them rich but not yourself.</p>



<p>But listen, if you are earning $500 weekly and paying yourself $100 and living on $400 each week, how much will you earn in just 2 months? It will be $800, right? What about you applying the third step below with this $800 that you have for the next month? You will earn over $1400 in addition to your weekly $100 which will be $400 for that one month.</p>

 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

<p>So now $1400 + $400 = $1800.</p>

<a href="Getting-rich-slowly.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;">See Also "Getting Rich Slowly"</a>

<p>What about doing this for the next month? $1800 * 2=$3600 plus the interest you will get on it almost $4000+ depending on your channel of investing. So, have you seen how a weekly savings of $100 has grown to $4000+ in just 3 months? Yes, that is how I started, and I want you to do the same.</p>



<p>But maybe you will ask me this.</p>



<p>Hey Justice.&nbsp; I don’t earn such amount weekly or am jobless and I don’t earn any money?</p>



<p>Well don’t worry, most of my student here started with nothing. Just comment below with your email and I will show you, “How to Make $500+ Weekly by Working Online.</p>



<p>But if you are working or doing anything that earns you a specific amount weekly or monthly.</p>



<p>Then begin by paying yourself 10% to 30% of all your earnings for at least 4 month and do investment with it by considering the third step below.</p>



<p>Wow, you have now earned $800 in just 2 months that is awesome, by paying yourself $100 weekly.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3. <strong>Do Investment With Your Earnings</strong> (Great way on how to get rich)</h2>

<img src="img/blog-img/investment.webp" alt="investment" title="investment" style="float:left;padding:10px;">


<p>Investment is one type of passive income, the whole idea behind it is by letting your money to work for you. I know before you searched on how to get rich, you already knew of investment because we hear it all the time. But there are too many forms of investment some could be investing in yourself, child investment but here am talking about financial investment.
<br><br>
 To be able to put your money at work you need to invest it but remember some of the mistakes that rich people do about investment that I told you in the introduction above. Don’t be in hurry to invest your money anywhere, just because you have heard investment can double your money without you physically working.</p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</script>


<p>Yes is true that with investment it doesn’t require your time or you to physically work before you earn. But remember where you are going to invest is the most important thing and that is the mistake most successful people today did during their start up on road to wealth creating.&nbsp;
<br><br>
 You need to have a deep financial knowledge or be well educated in where you want to invest, if you fail to do this trust me you will end up losing all your earnings. Remember most financial institute out there are just waiting to snatch your money from you but you may not know and be thinking it is a safe source to invest.</p>



<p>There are few proven sources that you can invest your money.</p>



<p><strong>Proven safe Sources for Investing</strong></p>



<ul><li>Government Banks</li><li>Government Companies</li><li>Well growing local business with registered details</li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you know any of the above sources that you wish to invest your earnings in, make sure to consult them and let them educate you more on their terms and conditions, most of them operate ranging from 1-3 month, 1-6 month, 1-9 month but they have different &nbsp;percentage rate of paying interest.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4. <strong>Leave On Budget</strong></h2>



<p>Budgeting in simple term is just about drawing a structure or analysis of your outgoing expenses and incoming cash for the purpose of spending it wisely and also to cut down unnecessary expenses. This may seem as something irrelevant because you have not tried it before, but just give it a try and you will see how beneficial it will have on your life.<br><br> Drawing a budget is not something that you should learn by perhaps there are some aspect of budgeting that you do need to learn before you can be able to implement it if only you plan on budgeting a group of company income.</p>

 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

<p>&nbsp;For the purpose of you alone I think there is actually no education require because you have been doing budgeting in your head in the past.<br><br> But this time you are not to be doing it in your head you need to grab a pen and paper and just listing down your expenses on one column of the sheet and your incoming cash on the other column. 
<br><br>
First you need to total both columns and make sure the expenses column is always lower than the incoming column, the opposite is term as budget deficit (that is if your incoming cash column is lower than your expenses).</p>



<p>Whenever you are drawing a budget makes sure you take your time and figure out all your expenses and list them if not it may go against your income column. Figure out those unnecessary expenses that do not provide any value to your life and get rid of it.<br><br> Remember the purpose of budgeting is to help you cut down expenses and to manage your money well, so always draw a budget and leave on it.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5. <strong>Be Financially Illiterate</strong></h2>



<p>There is a saying that says “The more you learn the more you earn” this proverb is not considered toward any general knowledge or studies than finance. Because if it referred to any general knowledge that we acquire in school then I will say it will be only professors who will become rich. 
<br><br>
But why then don’t they? Because this proverb is based on financial knowledge only.<br><br> Remember not all professors are financially illiterate most of them aren’t only few are those. Financial education is not thought in school and yes I will boldly say it again our education system is very poor that they don’t teach financial education, they only focus on accounting and budgeting but financial education is way more than that.</p>

 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

<p>If financial education is part or thought in school most of our professors would have been billionaires, by why then is it that only school dropout who are never had a college degree are the wealthiest people today. To name a few bill gate, Elon musk, Warren buffet, Albert Einstein none of these successful people had a college degree but what made them so rich life? Well is because their financially illiterate they had a burning desire to be successful and base on their focus they were able to teach themselves about finance.</p>



<p>Financial education is the most important thing you need in life if you want to know how to get rich, because without it you will just be following the old school rule that your parent had been telling you (go to school, study well so that you can get a better degree and get a good job that will pay you well with retirement insurance).<br><br> This rule is just a waste, it will only train you to work for the government for paycheck, but why should you wake up every morning to work for money while’s this same money can work for you?</p>



<p>Not the best focus and educate yourself about money all the time and you will see the essence of being financially illiterate.</p>

If you invest in yourself well you will enjoy it interest, remember am talking about your day to day activities in life not financial investment. There are so many ways you can invest in yourself to become or get rich in the future but I will only talk about the most important once.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"><strong>7.&nbsp; Have A Multiple Source Of Income</strong>.</h2>



<p>&nbsp;First of all you may ask, what is multiple source of income? Multiple source of income here is defined as the various ways through which we earn money to do our day-to-day financial transactions. To be successful and responsible person in future, you have to get various ways through which you earn money.<br><br> Some of the examples of the ways through which you can earn money includes; opening your own business and employ someone to work for you, working at &nbsp;different places and investing part of your salary to your business, invest in government companies or banks, etc.</p>



<p>&nbsp;For example, a medical doctor could choose to earn income as an employee, and join the staff of a large hospital, or work for the government in the public-health service or join the staff of an insurance company needing a doctor on its staff.</p>



<p>&nbsp; This same doctor could also decide to earn income as a self -employed person, and start a private practice, setting up an office, hiring staff and building a private list of clients. Or the doctor could decide to become an owner of a clinic and have other doctors on staff but he will not work in it.</p>

<p>The doctor could also generate income from being an investor in someone else’s business or in vehicles like the stock market, bond market and real estate.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important words are “generate income from”. It is not so much what we do, but more how we generate income.</p>

<img src="img/blog-img/newtwork with successful people.webp" alt="build Network with successful people" title="build Network with successful people" style="float:left;padding:10px;">



<p>Knowing how to get rich does not mean you should do everything yourself, besides it will be a great advantage to associate with those who are already successful. These people have a lot of experience that you don’t have so associating with them will have a great impact on your life than to walk on the road of success by yourself.
<br><br>
 Most wealthy people today are willing to help the young ones but they can’t come to you and say, hey do this and that and you will become rich, No they will never do such a thing because they know the purpose of what is called self-respect.</p>



<p>So is up to you to make the move first and they will welcome you and assist you calmly. I know what you are thinking now just wait a seconds, are you so shy or afraid to go and ask them for advice?.
<br><br>
 Don’t be let me show you a simple ways you can get these people to associate with.&nbsp; Do you know any rich person in your society that you think he or she can help you? Well just Google his or her name and you might see some of his or her contact information. <br><br>Once you this person contact information, let say email, Send him a respectful message, but remember because this is your first message he or she may not know who you are so it will be hard to trust you.</p>

<p>But you can do it in a cheerful manner and ones her or him notice that you are calm person he or she might reply you. But don’t be offended if your text is not replied immediately, you can wait for another week and send another text. Do it three or four times and if no reply just forget and look for another person because it could be that he or she is too busy for small talk. Another way you can find such people is by searching his name on Facebook and reviews their contact from their profile.</p>

<p>“If you wake up in the morning with no plan for the day just go back to sleep” To become rich in the future you first have a specific pattern as a guide to follow. When you follow plans in life there is a definite chance that you might succeed one day. <br><br>Almost all rich peoples in our time now have plans that they follow because with plans you will know how far you’ve taken your life to and it also serve as guidance.

<img src="img/blog-img/passive income.webp" alt="build passive income" title="build passive income" style="float:left;padding:10px;">



<p>There are plenty of ways to build wealth. Which one are you relying on? the stock market, a pension fund, retirement annuities, a job, a new business, the lotto. Financial wealth means different things to different people. It’s simply a matter of personal perception.<br><br> It may mean having the material things to fully enjoy life or having a stress-free lifestyle. What does it mean for you? Having a big house, a second home in the Swiss Alps, a fast car, flashy clothes or what about R1 million in your bank account? If you mentioned any of these material things then you haven’t fully grasped the concept just yet.</p>



<p>Wealth isn’t about money, it’s about time and realistically the only way to free up time is to increase your income and reduce the amount of hours you work. Would you rather work eight to ten hours for a boss each day or spend more time at home with your family? How about dedicating more time to your hobbies, travelling or starting a business? Sounds great, but you may view this as wishful thinking considering that there are debts to pay and mouths to fees.</p>

Remember that over used cliché work smarter, not harder.<br><br> The Secret is to generate income without working for it. This form of income is known as passive income and the wealthy use it to create more time to spend living their lives. As a result, they are able to work on relationships with friends and family, take their children to soccer practice, travel the world, start charities and work on new businesses.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">12. <strong>Consider Establishing your own business</strong></h2>



<p>Do you want to spend your entire life working for a company or the government and be tortured anyhow? Working for the government is not a bad approach but consider having your own business. To see the relevant of this, just imagine how joyful life the owner of the most growing business in your society and the free time that he has to spend with his or her family.<br><br> Knowing how to get rich is a great knowledge to have but won’t it be wise if you do it in easy way that will give you joyful life and much time to spend with your family?</p>



<p>I don’t mean you should just go out and start any business you like with your bank account balance no. Before you want to get into any business make you consider the competition so that the business will not fail when you soon discover high completion.<br><br> You need to have a startup capital to get into this but make sure your balance if almost 3* the capital to start any business because at first you might spend a lot before it will later become successful and if you don’t have enough money during your start up to ensure it growth just imagine how it will be.</p>
