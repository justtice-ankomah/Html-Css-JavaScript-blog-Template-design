  <br/>

<br/>
  <br/>
However it is scientifically proven that Rich People posses a strong and good habits than the poor. rich people are seen to have a common habits that they share in common which poor people don't have. 
<br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1. Rich People Avoid Over spending (First Habits)</h4>
Frugal Hollywood portrayals of rich businessmen often show young hot start gunners taking huge risks while they say something like.
<P></P>
"You have to spend money to make money baby" (this is not rich peoples habits).
<p  title="rich people habits"></></p>
This is not the case.
<p></p>
Cover the costs you need to, but avoid over spending. 
<p></p>
Avoiding over spending is one of the top ways rich people become rich in the first place and also their top habits. If you ever take a financial risk, it needs to be extremely calculated. Otherwise, keep costs as low as possible while still putting out a quality product. If you overspend on the little things, it will become a habit and soon you will be sinking way too much money into the company car Successful people develop reasonable budgets and they stick to them.

<p></p>
 It's been reported that the average American watches five hours of television a day (that is not rich people's habits ), that is way too much if you plan to make your mark in a capitalistic society. There is a point where relaxing after a long day becomes simple laziness.

What do Rupert Murdoch, Arianna Huffington and Oprah all have in common ?
<p></p>
Besides a billion dollars? 
<p title="rich people habits"></p>
They all meditate. People are hesitant to meditation, because they think it's a waste of time or boring. Ray Dalio attributed a lot of his fortune in life to meditation stating and he said, "Meditation, more than anything in my life was the biggest ingredient of whatever success I've had".

As Warren Buffet says "The difference between successful people and real successful people is that, real successful people say no to almost everything" 
<P title="rich people habits"></P>
You have most likely been told to try and say yes more in order to live a fulfilling life or even just to improve your networking skills, but this is not the case for the financially inclined individual. People who succeed have a singular focus. They know when to say no to someone, because they are able to identify it as a waste of their time. This does not always mean saying no to people trying to divert their work load, it also could mean saying no to a bad habit.
<P title="rich people habits"></P>
If you have a bad habit of sleeping or playing too much video game, you need to learn how to say no to these impulses. Have a goal in mind, and only say yes to activities that will increase your productivity

 Author Brian Tracy compares communication to typing, anybody can learn how to do it. When you communicate effectively, almost every part of your life, business and pleasure, improve astronomically. That is why business leaders spend a little time every day sharpening their skills. 
<p></p>
Richard Branson describes communication as an art and says it "is the most important skill any leader can possess". Like any art, however, it is a long path to mastery. If you already feel confident, know that there is always room for improvement.
<p></p>
 If you feel less than adequate, all it takes is a little practice to achieve major results.
