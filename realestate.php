    It’s remarkable to see how real estate investing can create so much wealth. You see it everywhere–TV, the web, or your friend who randomly decided to flip a house, it seems like everyone is making money in real estate. <br/><br/>
The real strength of real estate investment is in rental income, not market appreciation. Because real estate can be expensive, you may think that real estate investing is out of reach. But there are several ways that you can get involved in real estate with as little as $500 or with no money at all.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Most Investors Use a Shallow Analysis of Real Estate</h4>
But before we get into each method in detail, allow me to quickly go over the power of real estate investing. There are plenty of misconceptions.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
First, you cannot simply compare house prices to stocks since appreciation is only 1 of 5 ways real estate generates wealth.<br/>
Most investing sites will do some quick analysis and show you a graph like the one I made above. I’ve normalized real house prices and stocks to 100 in the year 1970 and also adjusted for inflation.
<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
When you compare the two with this sort of shallow analysis, clearly stocks outperform real estate by a lot. Stocks nearly triple in value. Homes went up only 40 percent.
<br/>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">The Strength of Real Estate is Rent, not Appreciation.</h4>
Just as a silly example, let’s say you purchase a terrible rental property and it earns only a 4% return on the value each year (after all expenses, vacancy, etc). I personally would never invest in this deal, but it’s a good working example with easily attainable numbers.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Now, we need to adjust the charts to account for rental income.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
The best way to compare is to add the total rental profit back into the price. It’s just like adjusting a stock price for collected dividends.<br/>
<br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Taking a Second Look</h4>
Now, look at the following chart of cumulative rents + house values versus stocks.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Starting at the same point, once you add even a measly 4% return from rents each year, real estate outperforms stocks over the period.
To be clear, changing the time frame can easily change the results. I chose 1970 simply because that is the data I have available. But, the evidence is still strong that real estate can perform very well, and the returns are very stable and smooth.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Anyone Can Get Involved in how to buy and sell real Estate Even If You Are With No Money</h4>
Of course, not everyone wants to be a full-time real estate investor, nor should everyone become one, but I believe that everyone could benefit by allocating some of their wealth into a real estate investment.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
The problem is–real estate is very expensive. Most people simply can’t drop a few hundred thousand and buy some rental property.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Luckily, there are a ton of ways to invest in real estate without becoming a real estate investor and without needing a ton of money.<br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1. Rent Out Your Old Home–Use the “Stepping Stone” Approach</h4>
Cost to Start–Under $20,000<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
You may have heard of something called the “accidental landlord.” It’s when someone lives in one home, moves, then rents out the old home. The “accidental landlord” never planned to be a landlord. They become one when they buy a second home.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Unfortunately, most single-family homes actually make terrible rental property because they can’t earn a profit. As the charts show, appreciation alone is a terrible reason to buy property.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
To make the strategy work, you need to plan it in advance. You should focus on buying a home in a neighborhood with great rents that are higher than the cost of the mortgage and all expenses. <br/>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Use the “Step Up” Approach</h4>
When it’s time to move into a better home you simply “step up” to the new home and rent out the old one. You’ve just become a real estate investor.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
I started in real estate with the stepping stone approach. My first property was a 3-unit multifamily near my grad school. We rented two units and lived in one for free. After a couple of years, we moved to a townhouse and rented out all three units.
<br/>

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">House Hacking</h4>
The great part was the rent on two units paid for all of our expenses while we lived there. When we moved, the 3rd unit paid for almost all of our expenses in our new home. This is a popular approach to real estate investing called “house hacking.”</br>
By house hacking, we were able to own two properties and never had to pay out of pocket each month for them.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
We’ve since moved again and the rent from the townhouse covers most of our expenses where we live now.<br/>
To do this you simply need to qualify for a normal mortgage. If you go with an FHA loan, you can buy a reasonably priced home under $200,000 in most states which will cost around $10,000 for a down payment and closing costs.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Since you’ll ultimately need two properties, the cost to get started will be around $20,000.
<br/>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2. Do a Live-In Flip</h4>
Cost to Start–$30,000<br/>
A slightly different but closely related strategy is the live-in flip.<br/>
The goal of this strategy is to buy a home that is livable (and therefore can be financed) but one that requires a lot of work. Work could include upgrading the kitchen/bathrooms, adding hardwood floors, finishing a basement/attic, or building an addition.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
This isn’t for the faint of heart because you’ll essentially live in a construction zone for a while. However, the potential for tax-free profit is huge. Approach a live-in flip exactly the same way as a standard flip.<br/>
<br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<br/>
The Process<br/>
First, you’ll need to find a livable property and also estimate the “after repair value” or ARV. You can do this by asking your real estate agent or reviewing comparable sales.<br/>
The next thing is to estimate your rehab budget. Do the work yourself to earn some sweat equity, if you have the skills. If not, get a good contractor in there to give you a price.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
<h6>Make Sure the Numbers Work</h6>
The offer you make should account for some profit. Take the ARV and subtract your profit goal and also subtract the repair costs. The total is your best offer.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
I estimate costs of $30,000 or more because you’ll need to fund the initial purchase ($10,000 or so if you go FHA) and you’ll need to fund the repairs. It’s impossible for me to give a blanket cost for repairs, but $20,000 will get a lot of work done if you do most of it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Fringe Benefits of Flipping</h4>
The great benefit of this strategy is the tax advantages. A typical flip is subject to all kinds of taxes on the profits. After three years of residency at the home, you’ll get most or all of the taxes wiped out since profits on homes are not taxed up to a certain amount. I’m not a tax professional, so please consult one before buying or making offers.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
This strategy is great because it’s pretty low-risk. If the numbers don’t work and you can’t sell for a profit, simply stay in the home! You need a place to live in anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<br/>
If you can sell for a nice profit, sell it and buy your next live-in flip. You could put more money down and have a lower mortgage or you could invest the money into the stock market or other investment.<br/>
Combine this strategy with the “stepping-stone” approach and earn even more. By refinancing the property, you will capture the equity and then also have the benefit of long-term rent.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3. Buy a “Turnkey” Property</h4>
Cost to Start–$30,000 – $50,000<br/>
If you aren’t keen on the idea of moving a lot or living in a construction zone, you may want to consider a turn-key investment property.
As the name suggests, a turnkey company takes care of almost everything for you. They help you find, analyze, buy, and manage the property. Every company is different and they don’t all offer the same services, but here are the basics:<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Finding and Analyzing the Turnkey Property<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
I’ve seen turnkey companies find a property in a variety of ways. Some buy and fix the property directly while others use a network of rehab companies to find their completed properties. Others provide fixer-uppers and give you the repair estimates and have you pay for upgrades.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Regardless of what numbers they give you, make sure you do your own analysis! <br/>Buying the Turnkey Property
Most turnkey companies have relationships with mortgage brokers or private lenders to help the deal happen. It’s still important that you are financially stable and qualified to purchase. <br/>
Managing the Turnkey Rental Property<br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
Turnkey companies will either manage the property directly or connect you with a reputable management company. Their reputation really relies on this piece, so they tend to take it very seriously.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Also, management companies can get a lot of referrals from turnkey companies. If there is a problem with your management company, you can sometimes go back to the turnkey company and ask for their assistance. The property manager may go out of their way to make you happy just to keep those referrals coming. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Cost of Turnkey Properties<br/>
Turnkey companies focus on cheaper properties that can range from $50,000 on up.
It requires approximately $30k to get started, though it can vary. Since you won’t be living in the property, you’ll need a conventional loan and 20 percent down. On a standard $100,000-150,000 house, that’s $20-30k plus closing costs.
You’ll also need to have some cash available as reserves in case you have any major repairs in the first year. <br/><br/>
The Risks of Turnkey Properties<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
I won’t lie, I’m not a huge fan of turnkey properties. A lot of people swear by them, which is why I included them in the list. <br/>
But there are a lot of risks with turnkey investing. First off, there is a lot of incentive for turnkey providers to charge you top dollar for the properties. Since you aren’t familiar with the out of state market, you probably won’t even realize it. <br/>
Also, property management companies have a lot of incentive to cause more repairs and tenant turnover. <br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

I generally distrust deals where the incentives don’t align and that’s why I shy away from turnkey rentals. But, I do know there are many very reputable turnkey companies out there and I know several people who swear by them.
Make sure you do your research before you buy. <br/><br/>
Roofstock<br/>
One option for finding a turnkey property is Roofstock.com. It’s an online marketplace for tenant-occupied real estate that focuses on connecting potential real estate investors with the right property. <br/>
Finding the Perfect Investment Property<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Using their website, you can buy an investment property based on the specs and reports provided then start earning rent from day one. Roofstock also offers thorough inspections on all properties, including the quality of the house, the estimated repair costs as well as the property’s financial information. <p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
There are transaction costs associated but they’re not too steep. If you’re a buyer, you will pay a 0.5% marketplace fee while sellers pay a 2.5% listing fee. This is much less than the commission you’d pay a real estate agent. <br/>
The properties are located all over the country in cities such as Saint Louis, Pittsburgh, and San Antonio. The handy search feature on the website allows you to sort using different criteria including turnkey properties, good school district, properties that meet the 1 percent rule, and so on. <br/>

Most of the properties listed are single-family homes although you may find a duplex or two as well. There’s very detailed information about each property from a complete inspection report, to detailed photos, a 3D model, and much more. <br/>
Many of the properties are tenant-occupied so you’d be assuming the current tenant contract from the previous owner. This means you can start collecting rent as soon as you buy the property, which is a bonus. <p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
Roofstock also helps you find financing for your rental purchase using an integrated financial solution. This can also help you close on the property quicker – in as little as 30 days. However, you may want to compare the rates they offer with other lenders to make sure you’re getting a fair deal. <br/><br>

A REIT, or real estate investment trust encompasses a wide range of offerings that invest in a broad range of real estate. It is required to distribute 95 percent of its earnings to shareholders and also pass a number of other tests in order to maintain its status as a REIT.
There are some exchange-traded REITs where you can theoretically buy just 1 share. However, there are also private REITs with massive minimum payments which is why the minimum investment has a question mark next to it.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
The great thing about a REIT is you can get some exposure to real estate in your portfolio by simply buying into a REIT with your brokerage account.
Unfortunately, the returns aren’t quite as good as syndication or direct investments in real estate. But it does help increase diversity and decrease volatility in your portfolio.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
There are three types of REITs–Private REITs, public exchange-traded REITs, and public non-traded REITs.
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Public Exchange Traded REITs</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

These meet all the SEC requirements to be listed on a stock exchange, but they are still a REIT. The benefits of these are they are highly liquid (a rare feature in real estate). The drawback is they have higher fees and most likely have lower returns due to the SEC regulations.
These are the most popular and least risky form of REITs.<p title="how to buy and sell real estate with no money"></p>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Private REITs</h4>
Private REITs are not listed on an exchange. They also don’t need to meet the burdensome requirements of the SEC. In theory, the returns can be much higher due to the reduced regulatory burdens. But there are a lot of bad private REITs out there with massive fees.
The lack of liquidity can also make it very difficult for many investors to get their money out of a private REIT.
