Have you notice that rich people behave in the same manner when it comes to other subjects
Like that of money while poor people turn to think to act in a way that is different from the rich. Could it be it be that money makes people to think differently or perhaps people who think differently from the norm turn to make more money and become rich at the end of the day. According to Bill Gate the owner of Microsoft “Rich People Believe that I Create My Life whiles Poor  People Believe Life happens to me “
Now that is a major difference between both parties.<br/>
Rich People see themselves  as being in charge hence they take responsibility for their life and determine what they want to become out of their life. Poor Poor on the other hand do not understand this hence they live life just the best way they know how to live and in the end they end up   creating
Terrible daily habit for themselves and these habit becomes responsible for the state of their financial freedom But remember our habit form us. <br/>
Aristotle said “we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit”.

<h6 style="color:blue;"> SO HERE ARE THE 10 THINGS ONLY POOR PEOPLE DO </h6> and I believe If you work on it, it will help you to become a successful person.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 1) Poor People Believe Money Is Evil</h4>

The beginning of the problem for poor people is that they think money is bad, as a result most people dislike rich people because they think that their all wicked, money is a tool that can be use for both good and bad, people who however as being bad are lazy people who scared of chasing their dreams hence they justify their actions by saying they do not want excess money because they don’t want to become bad people forgetting that money can be use for great stuff. You see if you truly believe in good thing helping people are part of it and you can not do this if you don’t have money so stop thinking like the poor chase your dreams become wealthy and change the world.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2) Poor People Blame Others</h4>

Poor people think that their poor because  their parent are poor or they grew in a poor environment or  they have no money to go to school and so what ?

</script>
<br/>
 they think circumstances with those people are responsible for their poverty, they  fail to understand that everyone is in charge of their life and can make it whatever they please to . Check out one or two rich people in your society, did you see how responsible they are? Or  are they only responsible for themselves ? yes they turn to blame themselves but poor people does not and always blaming other people for their mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 3) Poor People Spend Their Time Watching Television While Rich People Read</h4>

According to Robert Kiyosaki Rich have small TVs and big libraries and poor people have small libraries and big TVs. Poor People find pleasure in getting entertain which is why they sit in front of the screen all day long what reality shows is to find out what is going on in other peoples life’s or they will spend all their time on the internet and getting entertain in social media instead of spending their time in investing in  self-development they rather enjoy several hours of entertainment on TVs which is why they remain poor.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4) Poor People prefer To Get Paid Based On Time While Rich People On money</h4>

Poor People are not result oriented at all they like to come to work 5 days a week 4 weeks a month and then get paid for their regularity at work wether or not they get their dairy task completed.<br>
Rich people on the other hand prefer to be paid base on the result they achieve at the end of the day. Elon Musk said “ to get rich you have to be making money while you are asleep. <a href="educated_endup_poor.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;">CHECK ALSO "why most educated people end up being poor in real life"</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5) Poor People Thinks They Know It All </h4>

Have you ever heard a piece of advice from someone who is poor ? they always seems to know it without expertise, poor people think they know how best to make money they think their smart and strong enough to make money by working harder to earn more money while rich people keep learning growing and stepping out over their boundaries in search for self-development  poor people turn to be opinion native  about anything that is outside their ram of influence, they have an opinion on almost all subject that matters, they think they know it all.

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6) Poor People Focus On Saving While Rich People Are On Investment.</h4>

Saving is good but saving without intension is a poor decision because you will end up spending the money on things that don’t matter. Elon Musk Said “if you are saving your money for a rainy day what are you going to get ? Rainy days! Stop doing that. Instead of saving for a rainy day, focus on saving for a joyous day or for the day you wins your financial freedom. Rich people save though as investment while the poor save for rainy day.

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">7) Poor People Always Have An Excuse For Why They Have Not Made It </h4>

Ask someone who is poor this question and listen to what he has to say as to why he or she hasn’t made it, A Bunch of excuses you will hear. They think they have suffered enough and deserve to be hurt hence they keep sharing this single story “ of them having no money or opportunity to get a qualification, poor people always have a story to tell  whiles rich people on the other hand accept everything that is happening to them as an opportunity to become or remain successful.

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">8) Poor People Surround Themselves With Poor People</h4>

Aristotle said “ Evil influence is like a nicotine patch, you cannot help but absorb what sticks to you” also according to my own father Mr. Seth “ To be of good quality, you have to excuse yourself from the presence of shallow and callow minded individuals”. The truth is that you can’t expect to be around poor people and become a super hero in rich friend in their mix no it doesn’t work that way. Poor people are always around poor people like them, they spend their entire time talking about people rather than talking about ideas like the rich guys do, Remember ideas rules the world and when you have nothing relevant to offer how then  can you become rich.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">9) Poor People Complain About Every Problem They Never Find A Solution </h4>

The government is bad. The roads are terrible and the weather is such a big problem these days. You know what? I’m sick and tired of it all. Why can’t somebody just get it right for once? <br/>

Do that words work self-millionaire? no their the words of the poor their full time complainers for example most poor people who get in accident spend the next 5 days talking about the accident, what happened, how it happens and  so on whiles on the other hand successful people  will immediately call their insurance company to book and appointment and meet with it and their done rather than focusing on why it happens why don’t you find a solution to it and change it?
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">10) Poor People Only Thinks Of How To Make Money, Not How To Be Great </h4>

Mark my words, I will be a millionaire one day and I will own a lambo one day. Am sure by now you know where these words come from ? yes from Poor People, making money is ultimate for them they don’t think of how to become great their only interested in the things they can begin to  buy when they start making money, when you go ahead and ask them how they intend to make money  to buy these things? They say things like “oo me I mind my own business bill the brand and so on” .
