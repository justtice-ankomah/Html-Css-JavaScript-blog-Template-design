It's one of the most pewerful tools that one can use to create success and wealth. Ever try and move a two ton boulder with brute force ? Not the best approach, unless you're  aiming to strain a groin muscle! A more sensible way would be to wedge a plank under the rock and use it as a liver (assume that dynamite and heavy machinery are not at your disposal). At the end of the day, a two by four can achieve what muscle alone cannot. This is the power of leverage-doing more with less effort.
<br/>
Here Are Some Other Examples Of Leverage
<br/>
<h2 >1) Tools :</h2>
Tools are used in many aspects of our lives to make things easier. Doctors use X-ray machines to detect broken bones or CAT scans to identify tumors. Electric kettles are used for boiling water and toothbrushes for cleaning teeth. Facebook and Twitter are nifty internet tools that one can use to communicate with friends and family members. The list is endless.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<br/> <br/>
<h2 >2) Other Peoples Power (OPP) :</h2>
Everyday, we use the time and expertise of other people to make our lives easier. Entrepreneurs use other people to run their businesses, mechanics service our vehicles, medical doctors treat our ailments, baby sitters look after our children, financial planners give advice on  money-related matters and domestic workers help maintain our households.

<h2>3) Education :</h2>
Would you agree that it's a lot easier to find a good job in the corporate world if you have the relevant education ? Education empowers us to make better decisions, gives  us the confidence to start new ventures or teaches us basic life skills. This doesn't mean that uneducated people at a disadvantage. They use different sources of leverage such as experience and personal networks.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>4) Spare Time :</h2>
Spare time is an important form of leverage, especially for working professionals seeking financial freedom. There are stories of many people who became rich in their spare time by writing books, investing in real estate or painting. Use your spare time wisely to leverage your talents.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>5) Relationships :</h2>
Relationships are a great source of leverage. Remember that saying, 'its not how you know but who you know'. People influence our way of being and it's essencial to surround yourself with the right people. If your network consists of highly successful people, the chances are you'll also be successful one day. To help you achieve your goals, i recommend that you leverage your reletionships using four groups of people:
<br/>
<Ul>
<li>family </li>
<li>mentors </li>
<li>life coach </li>
<li>your team of business and / or investment specialist
</Ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>6) Failure :</h2>
We all set out to succeed. But did you know that failure can be a major contributor to success ? Success is not about winning at all costs, it's about shaping your journey using lessons along the way. The following quotes sum up my view on filure.
<br>
<br/>
<p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:17px;">"Losers are people who think that losing is bad. A winning strategy must include losing" (Robert Kiyosaki)</p>
<p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:17px">"The person who doesn't make  mistakes is unlikely to make anything"(Paul Anden)</p>
<p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:17px">"I haven't fail; I have had 10,000 ideas that didn't work "(Benjamin Franklin)</p>
<p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:17px">"If we don't get lost, we'll never find a new route" (Joan Littlewood></p>
<p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:17px">"Of the 200 light bulbs that didn't work, every failure told me something that i was able to incorporate into the next attempt "(Thomas Edison)</p>

<h1>There are two ways to build wealth using leverage:</h1>
<h2> 1) use more forms of leverage:</h2>
Develop your network, become financially literate, use other people's power, develop the courage to act on good ideas, learn from failure and use your spare time to invest in property or start a part time business.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2> 2) Use financial leverage :</h2>
How long do you think it will take to save R1 million in a bank account that pays 10% interest per year? Let's assume that you open your account with R1,000 and contribute R500 each month without making withdrawals.
<br/>
It will take you approximately 30 years! How Long will it take you to borrow R1 million at 10% interest and invest it else where to earn a return of 30%? Do you see what's happening here ? Average people try and use thier own money to become wealthy, where as rich people use other people's money to build wealth.
<br/>
<br/>
Financial leverage is about using debt to get ahead. Be careful with this one. When I say debt I'm referring to good debt not bad debt. Do you know what the differnce is ? Bad debt costs you money where as good debt makes money.
<br/>
<br/>
Ghanains households are renowned for piling up bad debt. On average, about eighty five percent of household income is used to service debt. This is one of the world's  highest rates. Unfortunately, Ghanaians are more concern  about driving fancy cars and living glamorous lifestyles that they seem to overlook the importance of simple budgeting and saving. People also tend to borrow money to keep up with Jones' and service existing debt.

<h2> Debt taken on to pay debt is a losing strategy. </h2>
It eventaully spirals our  of control and may damage all hopes of you ever becoming rich. Not only that , it's one of the primary causes of stress-related suicedes and health problems. Bad debt is extremly expensive, so the best way to manage it is to avoid it.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Types of bad debt include</h2>
<ul>
<li>credit cards with outstanding balances</li>
<li>personal loans for holidays, quad bikes or boats</li>
<li>Retail store cards with outstanding balances</li>
<li>Vehicle financing</li>
<li>Any credit used for financial lifestyle, cloths, food, gift and other consumables</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The following scenerios highlight two bad debt situations:</h2>
<span style="color:blue;font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;"> Scenerio 1:</span> Suppose you purchase the car of your dreams for R250,000. The bank grants you finance at 15% interest per annum over five years. Your monthly repayement is approximately R6,000. As soon as you drive the car off the dealer's floor, it loses about 20% in value. This is a bad debt situation as you need to cater for a depreciating asset that doesn't generate any passive income.
<br/>
<span style="color:blue;font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;"> Scenerio 2: </span> Suppose you paid for a  R40,000 holiday using your credit card. The debt will be paid over a three year period at 20% interest. Your monthly repayment is almost R1,500. After spending two weeks in Maurituis, you retrun home feeling refreshed and ready to take on the stressful world fo work life. Besides bringing home two weeks worth of great memories, you still have to cough up R1,500 for the next 36 months. This is bad debt situation. 
<br/>
<br/>
How are you curently  managing your debt ? <br/>
Are you managing your debt ? YOu can use the pointers below to assess your own situation:<br/>
1) Be honest with yourself. Are you a conscientious spender or excessive spender ?<br/>
2) Is your total monthly debt higher than your monthly income ? If yes, you're on the road to financial ruin.<br/>
3) Start paying off bad debt today and pay more than the minimum amount required each month. Cut up all your credit cards, except one which will be used for emergencies only.<br/>
4)A debt counseller may help you set up a plan to  eliminate your bad debt.<br/>
5) Track your spending and budget. If need be, file all your slips and invoices no matter how big or small. <br/>
6) Downsize and get real. You cannot live in a massive house, Use expensive toys or lead a luxurious lifestyle if you have limited income
You will be  surprised at how much cash you can free up by down sizing.<br/>
7) Devise a plan to acquire good debt and income generating assets.

<h4>GOOD DEBT :</h4> Is money that is borrowed from other people or institution to purchase income generating assets. It may be a loan to 
start a business or purchase property. The rich use good debt as a tool to generate enormouse wealth. However, it's a double edge sword. It can bring
you great returns or kill your cash flow if your're not careful.<br/>
Here's why good debt is so powerful.<br/>
Suppose a property investor is interested in buying a flat for R100,000. He (or she) has the option of paying cash or borrowing money
from the bank (i.e using leverage). Let's assume he purchased the property with cash.<br/>
What is his return after one year if he makes a profit of R20,000. His return is 20% (20,000 / 100,000). Suppose our investor
pays a R10,000 deposit and is granted a R90,000 bond. What do you think his return is now ? <br/>
After one year his profit is R12,000(R12,000 / 10,000). Not bad considering that you're likely  to get 13% from the stock market
in the long term. Do you see how financial leverage boosts the return on your money ? This is what you're after-growth.
