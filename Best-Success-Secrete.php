I started up as young guy in my early 20s where I found a great interest in money, for me I wasn’t a lucky child to be born into a rich family but rather poor family and I mean very very deep poor family where the whole family depends on only one source of income. And to say this source does not generate income for the family on regular bases but rather years over years and the money too is not  huge but very little, so you guest how poor our standard of living was .

So one day something clicked for me in a speech that I heard on the radio about how people use this success secrete  am going to show you soon to succeed in life. The speech was about how rich or successful people find new ideas and business secrete to succeed in life, the speaker explained it so well that it was like something easy you can achieve easily overnight.<br/><br/> I knew the speech was for me very well as I was the oldest son of the family whom the young ones were looking up to in the future. Yes they were all looking up to me in the future but they knew very well that I wasn’t going to make it because there is no rich man in the family to help unless is by luck. We had a believe that “before you can succeed in life there should be a family member who is rich to help before you can, if not forget”, but we were all wrong in our mind as we didn’t really knew the real secrete to succeed in life.  So here is the success secrete I learnt from the speech that has change my life for the best.
</h4>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="passive_income" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1) Turn Active Income Into Passive Income </h2>
This is one secrete the rich and the successful people don’t want you to know, but the real secret to success is the ability to be able to convert passive income into active income. But what is actually a passive income and active income ? well let me explain.
<br/>
<br/>
Passive income is the money you earn on a regular bases without you actually working for it. So does this mean there is a kind of money where people does not work for it but always get it on regular bases ? YES there is but the secrete is this kind of money you work on it ones and you get paid for it over and over again and again. Example.<br/><br/> Think of having a well growing company that you have employed well experience people to manage it for you, this will not require your physical presence in the company every day, you can choose not to even go there again but since you are the owner of the business and others are managing it for you and is growing you will get paid over and over. So that is how sweet passive income is, and imagine having many passive income business! I this case you will get enough time with your family and or other occasions. <a href="tenpassiveincomeideas.php" style="color:blue;font-size:16px;" title="Success Secrete to Life Best guide (2020)"> ClICK here to see ten passive income ideas you can start on your own without any capital</a>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">Active Income </h4>
So that brought us to Active Income, what is real meaning? Well Active income is the money you get paid for whiles working for somebody as an employee or working as a self-employed. This kind of money the moment you stop working the money stop flowing, yes you heard me right, if you don’t work you won’t get it. Think of working for a company as an accountant, secretary or having your own barbering shop, you will only get paid within those month that you physically worked for and I don’t think your boss will pay you when you are no more in the company I mean when you have been fired.
<br/>
<br/>
No the real difference here : Passive income does not require you to work but yet get paid whiles active income requires you to physically work before you can get paid.
<br/>
<br/>
So the point here is if you are currently working as and employee or self employed, focus on building passive income that will pay you over and over again. If not you will spend the rest of your life working as an employee, And let me tell you one secret “If you are working for the government or some company don’t think that kind of pay check can make you rich no, you are rather making the person you are working for rich” Because the more productive you are at work the more the company grows and hence the more your boss bank account increase. <a href="tenpassiveincomeideas.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;" title="Success Secrete to Life Best guide (2020)"> ClICK here to see some passive income ideas you can start making money on now</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="save_investment" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2) Save For Investment </h2>
There are better ways for investment, others with high interest rate, low interest rate and others brings in debt. But if you really know how to invest well and how the principles work! Trust me you will make huge money with it. <br/><br/>For me it all started when I read one book early don by then I didn’t know anything about investment, but after I got all the principles from the book do you know what I did ? I quest you will say no in response but let me tell you I did not just read the book and let the principles fade out but I took an action yes I did. Because see I was into books finding the most secret to success in life every day and I was hungry for it too. And trust me now my life has change by that book that I read and it does increase my bank account balance in 20% interest rate every three month without me working for it.

<br/>
So If you are reading this I really recommend that you save little amount of money and consult any banking agent or big business and invest in, but mind you before you invest in any business make sure you understand how it really works so you won’t end up causing yourself into big debt, if you want to go in safer way just invest in banks with high interest rate, does what am doing.<br/><br/> Also take your time and read something about how investment works, if you need a book with good knowledge about it contact me in the contact section of this page and I will send you the book I use. <a href="successsecrate.php" style="color:blue;font-size:16px;" title="Success Secrete to Life Best guide (2020)"> ClICK here to see some of Investment principles</a>

<h2 id="asset" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3) Know The Differece Between Asset And Liabilities </h2>



So what really is an asset and liabilities that I need to know the difference?  This question was asked by 21 year lady who consult me about how I made it in life. So here is what I mean by knowing the difference let take it one by one.
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">ASSET </h4>
Asset is anything you have that put money in your pocket. Simple right? Yes so simple but how to acquire it is the hassle.  So in simple team see asset as anything that put in money in your pocket, it could be anything you have ones it put money in your pocket is an asset for you be it company, investment, your experience and many more as long as that thing put money in your pocket is an asset. 
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">LIABILITIES</h4>
Whiles Asset put money in your pocket liability does the opposite. Liability is anything that 
take out money in your pocket. So anything you have that take out money from you is a liability to you ones it takes money from you is a liability.
<br/>
<br/>
So now that you know the difference how do you apply it as a student of money? Well focus on buying or achieving things that will put money in your pocket, i mean asset than things that will take out money in your pocket I mean liabilities. The more asset you have the more your earning will increase as a financial independence is fact of how much you earn not how much you spend. <a href="tenpassiveincomeideas.php" style="color:blue;font-size:16px;" title="Success Secrete to Life Best guide (2020)"> ClICK here to see example of asset you can acquire easily and free</a>

<h2 id="vision" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4)Have A Vission IN Life</h2>
According to Warren Bennis’s classic On Becoming a Leader, leadership is “the capacity to translate vision into reality.” This means that success starts with answering a fundamental question, What do I really want?
<br/><br/> Whether you call the answer to that question your mission statement, core values, brand identity or just your goals doesn’t really matter. Because “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”
<br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"

     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<br/>Here’s how Bennis unpacks the idea: The leader has a clear idea of what he or she wants to do—professionally and personally—and the strength to persist in the face of setbacks, even failures. 
<br/> The key word is “clear.” And clarity means writing it down.
<br/>
<br/>In fact, two of the most statistically significant factors that set the richest people apart from everyone else is that 81 percent of them maintain a to-do list and 80 percent focus on accomplishing a specific goal.
