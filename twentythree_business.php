    Small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy, no question about it. The numbers speak for themselves: 29 million = Number of small businesses in the US; 500 million = Number of patents filed annually in the US; 50% = Half of the private sector is employed by small businesses. <br/>
All it takes is one unique business idea (and sometimes a little money in a savings account to get started) and you could be there too. But coming up with an idea is the very thing that keeps a lot of people from moving forward at all.<br/>
The best business ideas are the simple ones that aim to solve a problem or fill a need. Good entrepreneurs are always asking ‘how can this be better’ or ‘what would fix this problem?’<br/><br/>

We can talk about business ideas all day, but you won’t get anywhere unless you get up and do something about it. PT has a bunch of resources to help you get started with your business, so use them as a guide.<br/>

5.	DJ for Events<br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1. Private Lesson Instructor</h4>
Music, sports, and dance are the most common types of lessons out there, but the possibilities are endless. What is something that you enjoy doing that others might like as well? You just have to be willing to teach and you can start your own studio one lesson at a time. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2. Event Planning</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

</script>
If you’re an organized person, you’ll probably do well with an event planning business. If you enjoy coordinating elements of weddings, parties, and other occasions, this could be a great side business for you. <br/>
Plus, there’s little overhead involved, which means more money in your pocket. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3. Personal Trainer</h4>
If you spend a lot of time in the gym, why not capitalize on it? People make promises at the beginning of each year to get in shape, so be ready to heavily promote your services in November and December. <br/>
You’ll also need to be ready to get people in shape for the summer, so make sure to get the word out around March each year. If you really want to make money with economies of scale, create a ‘boot camp’ class and charge admission. <br/><br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4. Mobile Detailing</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

This was one of the first businesses I started as a teenager and actually lasted through college. <br/>
The start-up costs were less than $100 and you could easily make that with one or two jobs. Don’t limit yourself to cars and trucks – think bigger and target people with boats, planes, and RVs. <br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5. DJ for Events</h4>
How many weddings have you been to with a terrible DJ? If you have an ear for music and throwing parties, you might consider starting a business as a DJ. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6. Videographer</h4>
The door to technology is wide open today giving video production aficionados the ability to use their creativity for profit. <br/>
A good quality HD video camera, sound equipment, and video editing software can put you on your way to creating online videos and even TV commercials for local businesses. You can even stay small scale and target small events like weddings and graduations. <br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">7. Massage Therapy</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

Opening a spa could be a great business if done right. Obtaining your massage therapy certification can take a few months, but it may be the ticket to a great side business. <br/><br/>
<h68. Lawn Care Business</h6>
One of my first businesses after college was a lawn care business. It’s surprisingly easy to get started as long as you’re willing to do the work. The biggest hurdle was battling the changes in

                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

My wife makes extra money by tutoring other medical school students in anatomy. The possibilities are endless when it comes to types of students and subjects so don’t be afraid to let others know of your willingness to tutor. <br/><br/>
<br/><h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">11. Freelance Writer</h4>
You don’t need to be a blogger to make money online almost immediately. If you’re willing to research topics and write articles, you can start up a freelance business and make anywhere from $15 to $50 or more an article. <br/>
If you have a favorite blog that you read, ask the editor if they hire staff writers and you might just land your first writing gig. <br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">12. Photographer</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

A quality photographer can charge upwards of $2,000 – $4,000 or more for weddings and other events. <br/>
A few gigs each year could result in a healthy little business for someone who is good with a camera. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">13. Dog Walker and Pet Sitter</h4>
People love their pets. And many are more than willing to pay someone to take their dog on a walk while they’re at work or watch their pets while they’re away on vacation. If you love animals, this could be a perfect unique business idea for you to explore. <br/>
Not sure how to find your first dog walking or sitting gigs? Thankfully, there’s a site that’s dedicated completely to connecting dog sitters and walkers with pet parents<br/>
Rover can help you promote your business to dog owners that are looking for your services. Rover says that dog walkers who use their site can make up to $1,000 a month. And their Rover Guarantee will protect your services up to $1,000,000. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">14. Web Designer</h4>

When PT dove into blogging full time, he supplemented his business income by making websites with wordpress. He was able to make an extra $100 to $500 with minimal effort. With a little training, you can teach yourself the skills that you need to develop sites for businesses, churches, and other bloggers too. <br/>
Spend some time researching custom WordPress themes. And you’ll also want to learn how to sign up for hosting services, register domains and point them at host servers. <br/><br/>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">15. Tech Support Professional</h4>
Small businesses don’t always have the money to hire a full-time IT department and that’s where you come in. <br/>
Contract with small businesses to be their 24-hour tech support or provide online support to websites owners who are clueless when it comes to fixing a crashed site. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">16. Interior Designer</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

Some states require that you pass a certification test to become an interior designer. If you’re serious about this business idea, that should be good news to you – a lot of people might give up on pursuing it as a business with this barrier to entry. <br/>
Don’t let that keep you from starting a business as an interior designer if you’re really passionate about it! <br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">17. Online Store Owner </h4>
A while back, PT interviewed Steve Chou of Getrichhome.com and discussed how his wife earned a six-figure income by creating an online store. <br/>
They didn’t even know how to spell HTML, but ended up figuring out how to make a profitable store online within a year. Listen to the podcast if you’re curious how they did it. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">18. Health Consultant</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

This is another area that might require certification depending on your state. If you want to become a registered dietitian or nutritionist, you may need to pass an exam and take continuing education courses. <br/>
But the overall job outlook for this field is expected to rise, so now might be a good time to get started with business as a health consultant. <br/>
PT lost 80lbs using the health program MyBodyTutor.com. Check out their program and apply to become a “body tutor”. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">19. Blogger</h4>
There’s no question that a blog can eventually develop into a business. Revenue from advertising, affiliate sales, products, and eBooks can turn a website into business in itself – but it takes time. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">20. Problem Solver</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

The last idea is a little vague, but it’s really all about creating something that people need and going after it 100%. One of my favorite businesses (or ‘why didn’t I think of that’ idea) is Dollar Shave Club. For $1 a month, they’ll send you a razor every month – genius! They identified a problem and started a business to fix it – and that’s what it’s all about. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">21. Virtual Assistant</h4>
Virtual assistants tend to work as freelancers from home and set their own schedules. If that kind of work style sounds appealing to you, you may be a great fit to start a virtual assistant business. Virtual assistants can make anywhere from $10 an hour to upwards of $100+ an hour depending on their skill level and expertise. <br/>
To find virtual assistant jobs, you can list yourself on freelance sites like Upwork, Guru, or Fiverr. <br/><br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">22. Bookkeeper</h4>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Keeping accurate books is important for any business. But many small business owners don’t have the time or know-how to handle their own bookkeeping. That’s why if you’re an organized and detail-oriented person, you may be able to make good money as a freelance bookkeeper. <br/>
You don’t have to be a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) to work as a bookkeeper. But unless you have a background in accounting, you’ll probably need some training. Ben Robinson’s Bookkeeper Business Launch could help you gain the skills that you’ll need to build a lucrative bookkeeping business. <br/>
Ben is a CPA who has started two accounting firms. And he’s helped over 7,000 entrepreneurs start their bookkeeping businesses. <br/>

If you’ve listened to a radio commercial, an audiobook, or even a work training course today, you’ve probably heard a professional voiceover actor. Professional voice actors who work hard at perfecting their craft can make great money<br/><br/>
