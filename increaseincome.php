    When you are struggling to make ends meet, or you want to reach your financial goals more quickly, you may be looking for ways to boost your income. There are short-term income solutions like taking a second job, but if you know that you need to have a higher income to get by, you need to look at long-term solutions to your problem. As you plan, it is important to consider the tax implications of earning extra money so you do not end up owing ​extra taxes. These solutions can help your income.​​​

   <h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1.
Open a Side Business </h4>
One way to increase your income is to open a side business that you enjoy. This will likely start out as something that you do part-time while you are still working at your original job, but if you are smart about it, you may be able to grow it into something that you do full-time.  Find something that you really enjoy doing or that you believe in and try to start working at it. It helps to have a business plan. You will also want to make sure that you are not putting more money into the business than you are taking out.

There are a variety of business options that you can do that really match your skills and interests. If you open a business similar to what you do for your job, you will need to make sure you are not violating any competition agreements and see if there are rules about taking clients with you so that you do not run into problems later on.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2.
Go Back to School </h4>
Another option is to go back to school. With most degrees, you can increase your earning power within your profession as you move up from bachelor’s to master’s to a doctorate. Not all fields are this way, and you want to make sure you are studying a field that will give you a return on the money and time that you are putting into your education. You may also want to see if you qualify for a tuition reimbursement program through your work, which can make going back to school easier. 

If going back to school for an additional degree is not a good fit, consider going back to get additional certifications for your current field of work. This may be less time consuming and less expensive and help you earn more money.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3.
Make Money with Your Hobbies </h4>
You can put the things you love doing in your free time to good use. There are a lot of ways to cash in on your hobbies, and if you are creative, you can make quite a bit of money in your free time. You can start by opening an Etsy store to sell your crafts or artwork. Be sure that you charge enough to cover both your materials and time. You can also sell patterns or designs if you can come up with them on your own.

Another way to profit from your hobbies is to create a YouTube channel or show based on the hobby. You can show how to make the items or review items that you use on a regular basis. If your hobby is gaming, you can even do videos of walkthrough and commentary with your friends. It can take time to build a following.  However, if you stick with it and are consistent this may turn into a great way to make extra money.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4.
Find a Way to Build a Passive Income Stream </h4>
Another great way to increase your income is to build multiple passive income streams. Most of these are a result of a blog, website, or YouTube channel that you set up online. It takes time and a lot of effort to begin earning real money. You should focus on a niche that you really enjoy researching about or do something more general. It takes work, and time to build an audience, and you will want to find ways to engage the audience. If you are interested in doing this, you need to be comfortable using all types of social media and reaching out to people online. There are a lot of success stories, but even more stories of people who did not make it as big.  

The key to passive income is to build up a solid base that will generate revenue for you. If you write books, you will need to have four to five published before you see the passive income begin to be established. With a blog or website, it can take several years. This is a long-term project and it should be about something you really enjoy.

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5.
Ask for a Raise or Promotion </h4>
A final option you should consider is asking for a raise or a promotion within your company. You may also want to look for a better job at a different company once you have additional work experience. Your employer may offer a training program for future managers or give you the opportunity to complete training that will increase your job skills. If you enjoy the line of work that you are in, this is a very good way to increase your income. 

Do not be afraid to look for a new job if you are not making enough money to cover your expenses. It can be frustrating to be in a job where you feel stuck or underappreciated. Take the time to look for a new job regularly.
