    <h4 style="color:darkblue;position:relative;top:10px;">Making money online in Ghana has become easy now adays, unlike those days where airtime was being bought at huge price, and making it hard for poor people to access the internet. Now things are cheap and you can easily make money online in ghana just by spending ghc 20  or less in a month </h4>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2> so how can you make money online in Ghana ? </h2>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
well i will do talk about myself a little. As a computer programmer the internet is what i spend almost 80% of my time on and the rest is being on the screen, doing nothing than coding.<br/>
<br/>
I have earn a lot of money over the past 5 years on the internet and here is how i do it and new ideas that really works 
</p>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">1. YouTube</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 The video sharing site YouTube is another platform where young people, in fact, anyone can earn money online. With YouTube, you create a channel and like blogging, you choose a subject that you love and a viable niche. Your channel must attain a certain minimum subscribers or a set minimum hours of view over a given period to qualify to monetize your channel and content.
 </p>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">2. Manage social media for businesses</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 If you have a knack for social media, you could potentially get paid to manage various platforms for others. Many businesses are too busy running day-to-day operations to stay on top of their Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest accounts – and will pay someone with the knowledge and time to do it for them. To find these jobs, ask local businesses and check sites like<br/><br/>  <a href="https://www.upwork.com">upwork</a> and  <a href="https://www.problogger.net">Problogger.net</a>

<br/>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">3. Answer Questions</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 If you’re a subject matter expert, you can get paid for your expertise. Sites like <a href="https://www.justanswer.com">JustAnswer</a> will pay you to answer questions either on the phone or online. Just register, enter your area of expertise, and get started to begin earning money on the side.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">4. Sell stuff online</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 If you have high-quality items to sell, there are a slew of online marketplaces you can use. Just make sure you understand the fees associated with your sale before you take the plunge. Where neighborhood Facebook pages and Craigslist ads are free, many online marketplaces or consignment shops charge for ads or require you to fork over a percentage when you make a sale.
 </p>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">5. Review websites & apps for cash</h2>

 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 Well it seems like you're pretty nifty with a web browser, so perhaps it's time to turn pro and browse websites as a paid and fun job!
 <br/>
 Introducing <a href="https://www.UserTesting.com" style="color:darkblue;font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;">UserTesting.com</a> a new platform that pays everyday people to review all kinds of websites. Each review takes around 20 minutes and bags you $10 (£6.50) via Paypal.

<h2 style="color:darkblue">6. Write and publish a Kindle eBook</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 If students are good at anything, it's researching and writing. With the Amazon Kindle store, anyone can publish an eBook and make money.
 <br/>
 And the Kindle app is now available on almost any device (laptops, iPads, smartphones and yes, Kindles) so your global market is huge!
 <br/>
 <a href="get-rich-with-nothing.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;" title="GET RICH WITH NOTHING">CHECK HERE to see HOW TO GET WITH STARTING WITH NOTHING</a>
 <br/>
 List your book for ghc50 - ghc200 and you earn 70% of the sale. Considering Amazon is the ultimate selling machine (and remember people are looking to spend), that is a fantastic deal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The key to success with eBooks is to create value, and write non-fiction. Simply bundling information you have researched and compiled on a common problem (eg. 'secrets' to finding a job) and then presenting it in an easy to digest format (an eBook) justifies someone spending a few quid on it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another big tip is to have a great cover design so it stands out, and once your book is live on the Kindle store it's really important to get some reviews so it shows up higher in results. Encourage readers to leave an honest review at the end of your book.
 </p>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">7. Become your own bank</h2>
 <img src="img/blog-img/ghana-money.jpg"   alt="best strategy to make money in Ghana"/>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 'Peer-to-peer' lending is the future of banking. It cuts out the middle-man, passing on higher interest rates to you and cheaper loans to borrowers. And it's all managed online from the comfort of your sofa.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Founded in 2009, RateSetter was the first to reimburse lenders on late payments or defaults through its 'Provision Fund'. Effectively it is designed to be like a normal savings account. To date RateSetter say no investors have ever lost money, and they are fully FCA regulated.
 <br/>

 <br/>
 Right now you can expect to achieve up to 5% fixed return, depending on how long you choose to lend for. If you can, go for the ISA account to earn interest tax-free.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There's no fee to withdraw your money from RateSetter, unless you lock into a 1 or 5 year higher fixed interest rate where the early withdrawal fee is 0.3% and 1.5% respectively.
 </p>
 <h2 style="color:darkblue">8. Work as a charity collector</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 Ok, so this job takes a certain kind of person, as you'll have to take a lot of rejection and be persistent.<br/>
 But if you are bubbly, personable and reckon you could sell ice to an Eskimo then this could actually be a great student money making idea. You get paid commission on new sign ups (typically around ghc20).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Have a look at <a href="https://www.Wesser">WESSER as well as charity websites like <a href="https://www.Oxfam">OXFAM</a>

 <h2 style="color:darkblue">9. Source property for wealthy investors</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 We all know how much money there is in property, but on the surface (with house prices as high as they are) you might be thinking this market is off-limits.<br/><br/>
 Truth is, lots of people make a great deal of cash simply sourcing suitable properties for wealthy investors who simply have no time.<br/><br/>
 <a href="getting-rich-slowly.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;" title="getting rich slowly">CHECK HERE to see "HOW TO GET RICH SLOWLY"</a>
 The trick is to find properties below market value (BMV) by avoiding estate agents and instead flyering your area with your contact details offering to buy houses. Then approach investors with a no-brainer offer to pass on the details of cut-price property in exchange for a % of the sale value.

 Most cities will have monthly networking events for landlords and property investors. Track these down, sign up, put on your best suit and go along with lots of business cards. Or you could start on LinkedIn or even Twitter to build some initial contacts.
 <br/><br/>
 As you might imagine, this isn't necessarily a quick way to make money but once you've got a few investors in your phone book it can prove to be very lucrative in the long run

 <h2 style="color:darkblue">10 Online market trading</h2>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">
 Whilst this isn't necessarily an easy way to make money, investing in stock markets can be lucrative if you learn to do it properly and safely. By the same token, you may suffer significant losses if you don't take it seriously.<br/><br/>
 Today there is no need to fund the yachts of Wolf of Wall Street style stock brokers. You can do it all yourself with the help of online market trading platforms.

<h2 style="color:darkblue">11. Affiliate marketing</h2> <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do you know you can make a relatively good amount of money online that can help you to quite your day to day job through affiliate marketing? </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Well, in case you don’t know or this is your first time of hearing of affiliate marketing then let me explain what it means to you. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Affiliate marketing is the promotion of other peoples product on a commission basis to get a certain percentage of money on the product sold.  It, simple but let me throw more stones on it because it be overwhelming to understand especially if today is your first time of hearing it. In simple terms, you see there are so many online marketing places out there including amazon  clickbank and ebay. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">All these online marketing platforms have sellers with huge number of products waiting for advertisers to promote it for them. So what is involve in it is, you have to sign up to one of these website let say clickbank as an affiliate marketer. Then you log into the market page with your login details. You will see a lot of product with price, product name and promotion percentage rate. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">So, what you have to do next is, you have to click on any of the product you want to promote. Now let me explain what is involve in promoting others peoples product, because you just don’t have to wastes your time and promote others people product for them to generate more sales without you benefiting from it. </p>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">The promotion is simple. Whenever you click on any product you will be given a specific URL or link with your id. So what is involve is, you will share this URL on other platforms be it, social media, personal blog or direct email to friends.  So whenever anyone clicks your 	URL and makes a purchase of the product, you will get a certain percentage of the product sold. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">You can see the commission or the percentage rate of what you will earn on a single product sold on the product description at the platform. And normally the higher the price of a product the higher your share will be. For me I think affiliate marketing is the easiest way to make money online in Ghana by just sitting in the comfort of your house.  </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">It does not require any capital to start, all what you need to get into this business is to, have a smart phone or laptop with good internet connection. No need to pay any money to others before you can get into it. No, don’t let anyone lie to you of such thing. Just search for more details of any of the affiliate programs I have mentioned above and sign up and get into it. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">You can, share your links either on facebook, youtube comment post, twitter, instagram and personal blogs. </p>
<h2 style="color:darkblue">12. Start your own blog</h2>

</script>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do With blogging I won’t talk much about it because I have said a lot on it in this platform in the past. All what I will say is, if you want to make some good amount of money. Then consider starting a blog right now. Let me tell you a personal story. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do When it comes to online, I will say almost 90% of my monthly earning is from there. But wait, I don’t earn all this from blogging alone. Am a computer programmer who is into graphic design, web development, software engineering, blogging, wordpess setup, wordpress theme development and selling, wordpress plugin development and SEO specialist. </p>
<p>https://getrichhome.com/get-rich-with-nothing.php </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do Yes, all those so just imagine if I tell you 90% of my earnings are from online, it shouldn’t be a surprise. That is why you don’t see me around moving up and down. Am always busy on client project and personal stuffs too. </p>
 <p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do With all the above experience I will say almost 40% of my earnings are from my online client (I develop website, softwares, graphics and worldpress themes on payment for them. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do I have been made good money online through programming. But recently, almost 2 years ago I worked on a client SEO project and within just one month it got rank on the second page of Google search engine. Within the next 4 month then his ecommerce business was ranked number one on the first page of Google and Bing. </p>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do It was so surprising because most of my SEO works takes almost 6 month before it get to the first page. So he was surprised and asked whether I have been learning SEO through blogging. I said no I paid for a course. He said ok and continued. May I suggest you to start your own blog and promote your SEO skill? I said what, blogging? I have my fotolio and do how you got to know of me so why should I start a blog, my fotolio does it all. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do He said no and continued. There are thousands of peoples searching for SEO specialist to work on their project for them on search engines. If you will agree with me and start your own blog, trust me, you are going to be overloaded with work. I said, really? He said yes and continued. Because you are an SEO pro and you are going to rank your blog on the first page. The more people search and click on your blog the more projects you will have. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do I said okay, I will give it a try tomorrow. He said no, no, you have to finish my other project first I have one more project I want you to work on. So I finish with his project and developed a good looking SEO friendly worpess theme for my blog. It took me only five days to finish the theme and some others plugins. I set it up and as slow as it may see. Within the first 5 month I saw no result because my blog domain name was too new and I had no domain authority to compete with those with the big ones out there. </p>

<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do It wasn’t a surprise to me because I know how SEO actually works with a fresh domain with no authority. So as an SEO specialist already I knew how to achieve this fast. Within the first year I had only 13 blog post because all what I was focusing on was to achieve a domain authority. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do But guess what? Do you know what happened within the next 2 month after the past year? 9 of my blog post were ranked at the first and second page of Google. Then I began getting more SEO client. And yes up to now, I will say I have been blessed with the blog. It had helped pay most of my bills because week after week I keep getting more clients.    </p> <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do Blogging actually wasn’t what I was into. My focus was to get more clients. But what drive me into blogging was, most of the clients that I got almost 70% of them projects were on blogs. So as I was working on it for them, sometimes I do see how much they have been making through their blog and that inspired me to blogging. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do And to tell you the truth this blog that you are reading right now is making over $299 monthly through affiliate marketing and ads. And guest what I have sold almost 9 blogs. And am actually planning on selling this one too by next year because am working on this one Success is money.  Success is money is only 3 month with only 15% domain authority. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do It not making that much money but I want it to develop to some point before I sell this one. </p><p style="font-weight:bold;">CHECK ALSO <a href="onlypoor_do.php" style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">10 THINGS ONLY POOR PEOPLE DO </a></p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do Well, it okay, I have bragged a lot about myself. But is not bragging because we all know of this. When something is working for you and you can’t shut up of letting others to know of it. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do So all the above is to inspire you to get into blogging. Trust me I have made good money blogging and not only good money real money. </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;color:black;">Do Blogging is profitable so just get into it. But one problem I see most bloggers have is that, some will get into it and see no result in the first 1 or 2 year. This is because SEO is slow and if you are not an SEO specialist you may think of giving up because of you working hard and seeing no result. Yes only those who does SEO well sees great result in the first 5 month and above. </p> <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
