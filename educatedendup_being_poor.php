	<h5 style="color:darkorange; padding:20px;background-color:#f2f2f2;border-radius:10px;">
    One best financial quote from my favorite mentor Bill Gates says <mark> “ If You Were Born Poor It's Not Your Mistake But If You Die Poor It's Your Mistake" </mark> How do you understand this quote then and what effect does it have on the poor or the rich ones ? Well there won't be any exams so don't worry if you don't get it. But it simple about  ” Responsibility”, what do I mean by this I will tell you. You see when I was little boy I keep blaming my parent for not working hard in their 20s for us to be rich but we ended up being poor. So now am kind of putting my responsibilities on my parenting and letting them think that my success depends on them but I was totally wrong when I realize the real meaning of this quote. 
    You were taken to school even before you knew what it was. At first it was like a playing ground but within a few years it became obvious to you that it a lot of work to remain in school, if you are like most of us you hated everyday of your life in that environment, but you couldn't live because school was preparing you to succeed in life or so your parent made you believe. Eighteen to twenty-one years after your first day in school you graduated with high hopes most likely for a good job, it only then the reality of real life started showing itself to you. After spending one dickey in the real world you start asking yourself "whether school actually thought you how to succeed in life?”.  In this section i will be explaining to you!  "What it takes to succeed in school versus what it takes to succeed in real life".

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1) SCHOOL HATES FAILURES; LIFE IS ABOUT FAILURES :</h4>
I remember checking my result in a diploma course I did in the first year, I was the best student in my class yet I wasn’t happy, I wasn’t happy because I didn’t score up to what I wanted, being a great student I was I hated to score 70/100 for me to be happy I have to score 90 something that is what it takes to be a great student you must hate failure to be a great student. While this is good for academic purpose hating failure has a way of conditioning us to think that failure is a bad thing altogether, unfortunately in the real world failure is the name of the game. You have to be strong enough to get out and try things even when there is no assurance of success you have to be strong enough to smile at failures, while school condition us to hate failures! Failure is what it takes to succeed in real life.
   <br/>
   <br/> 
<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2) SCHOOL IS ABOUT COMPETITION, LIFE IS ABOUT COOPERATION : </h4>
My default brain certain  in school was all about competition, I wasn’t just satisfied to have a good score  always, I  wanted  to top the class in all  the  exams we did. School conditions us to see life as competition whiles in the real sense of it life is about cooperation but school don’t teach us how to cooperate with others and does why most people are poor.  To succeed in life you must know how to build teams, bring people together and partner with others.

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3) SCHOOL HAS NICE TEACHERS, LIFE IS A TOUGH TEACHER :</h4>
School has good teachers so smile to play and teach you, life is a jungle, it a tough place, you don’t get anything unless you fight for it, fighting for it means that you will fall and fail, cry and more it tough and rough in life you must prepare to go through hell before heaven .

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4) SCHOOL GIVES LESSONS BEFORE TEXT, LIFE GIVES TEXT BEFORE LESSONS : </h4>
In school the teacher gives you lessons then text your understanding of the lesson but in life you get the text before the lessons, though this is a tough way to learn but is the best way, because when you experience pain you are much more likely to pay attention to the lessons than if the lesson come’s and text later.

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5) SCHOOL PREACHES OBEDIENCE, LIFE IS ABOUT DISOBEDIENCE : </h4>
You see school gives us rules, formulas and procedures so to succeed at school you must follow all these formulas as seen in mathematics, chemistry and every other subject. Resuming at school at a certain hour and closing at certain hour, wearing certain uniform and pretty all other stuffs is about rules that require your obedience which makes you worship lord and others, unfortunately in the real world success only goes to the people who walk against the crowd! This requires disobedience. To succeed in life a part of you must be willing to disobey what everyone thinks is normal or conversional, you must be courageous enough to go into the bush and make a way where there is none.

<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6) SCHOOL MAKES YOUR BRAIN SMART, LIFE MAKES YOUR HEART STRONG </h4>
Several studies have proved that your success in school doesn’t have any co-relation with your success in the real life, however one thing does and that’s the emotional intelligence. How people are able to deal with emotions such as anger, fear anxiety and rest really influence how far they can go in life because the game of life is the game of the heart, you must be strong not only in the brain but also in the heart to be able to take actions despite fears and must be able to control fears, anger and you must be willing to fight for your dreams.

<br/>
<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">In summary:</h4>
 School hardly prepares you for the real world but you can train yourself to  achieve greatness, don’t expect life to be easy, don’t wait for a map, be willing to get out without any assurance or success and don’t see life as a competition don’t be a lone ranger, learn how to partner and cooperate with people, accept failures as a necessary part of success and train your heart to overcome emotions that may want to keep you a coward.
