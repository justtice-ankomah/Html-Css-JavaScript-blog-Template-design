 The rich man said “Poverty Is The Root Of All Evil</h4>
<h6 style="font-size:20px;">
There was once a poor man and a rich man who lives in the same area. The rich man believes that poverty is a great evil whiles the poor man believes that being rich or having a lot of money is also a  great evil. <br/><br/>

Because the rich man believes in money, he worked hard in life and acquired a lot of asset that was generating a lot of money for him every month, he made his mind of not working for money but rather let his money work for him, he had a very strong financial aptitude and was financially educated in life, he does understands how really money works and he was always increasing his revenue almost every two month by purchasing more asset and establishing other companies.<br/> <br/>

Hmm what  of the poor man who believes that having enough money is evil ?<br/><br/>
Because he had this mindset that money is evil, he was working hard although, but he will spend all his entire earnings in a particular month just after the next few days. He wasn’t thinking of investment, buying asset or even savings and then to establish a business no, he had a very bad financial aptitude and never bordered to learn anything about money. He later got married and had three children’s. <br/>

By the time the rich man was 25 years old he was really rich and was the richest man in the neighbor-hood. He got married and had three children’s. Later on at his 70s he got sick and was transferred from one hospital to the other but none of the doctors was able to help, one morning his wife wake up and saw a latter on their door, it was a sad news for the family, aww  what exactly was in the letter ? well here is what was written in the middle end of   it<mark> “ dear madam we are really sorry, we tried our possible best to save your husband’s life  but his sickness was so serious that he lacked a lot of energy to stand on the treatment that was ongoing. Please we are sorry to tell you that your husband is dead “</mark><br/> <br/>
Aww what will happen to all his money that he has left behind and who will take care of his wife and the kids?<br/><br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

On reading to this section of the letter the woman collapsed and she was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, and God being so good after 2 hours she got fit and she was discharged from the hospital. One month later the people in the neighbor-hood help to buried the man finally. Though this was a sad news for the injured family and the peoples in that area.<br/>
<br/>Two weeks later another incident happened. The poor man was also reported dead by being involved in a car accident. The people in the neighbor-hood grieved a lot with the poor family and later buried him. <br/>
 <br/><h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">So What Happen After The Death Of The Rich Man And The Poor Man? </h4><br/><br/>
Well because the rich man laid a strong foundation for his family. After a few years of grieving by the injured family , the  children grew up and took over their father’s possession! the companies, asset and the investment that was left behind. They lived a good life with their mother 
<img src="img/blog-img/richfamily.webp" alt="family of rich members" style="float:left;">
and never struggled financially some grew up and became doctors and computer programmers and their lives was really going on well .<br/>
<br/><br/><h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">But What About The Poor  Family?  someone will surely ask </h4><br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

Hmm things were not going well as you may be expecting no. There was no investment, asset, companies and buildings left behind , the only thing that was left behind was debt yes debt real debt that was left for the poor family to be paid. How did this debt happen? During the burial of the poor man, he left no money for his funeral nor for his family, so the family has to go for a loan at the bank before they were able to buried their poor father who thought having enough money is evil. <br/>
The kids and the wife 
<img src="img/blog-img/poorfamily.webp" alt="family of poor members" style="float:left;">
struggled very hard years over years in life before they were able to pay for the debt and that wasn’t the only thing. Because they were broke, the youngest kid got ill and his soul couldn’t be saved so he joined his poor dad  later on after his burial.. Aww this is very sad but what brings this all ? <br/>
is a bad mindset that their father got that having enough money is evil <br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script>
<br/>So now that you know what will you do?<br/>
Will you follow the poor man or the rich man advice? Well the ball is in your court and each man for himself so better choose for yourself </br/><br/>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> IN SUMMARY </h4>
Don’t think having enough money is evil no. Remember the bible even says money is good with money you have power.  Just imagine waking up one morning and finding billions of dollars  in your bank account balance, will you be happy ? surely you will.<br/>
The rich man believes that money is a great tool and if you use it well it could mean a lot to you in life whiles the poor man had an opposite mindset to this. But in the end what happens to family of  both parties after their death.
