   <span style="color:blue;">" Show Me Your Friend And I Will Show You Your Future "</span>"   You see in my blog getrichhome.com here I talk a lot about success, motivation, business ideas, sales, entrepreneurship
and wealth creation. And one of the thing I keep saying again and again and that is <mark>“don’t hang around with poor people”</mark> and some people take it the wrong way, OO there you always judge people character by how much money they make and save, no does not what I mean because people
without money! that’s just one form of poor, there are many many forms of poor but today am going to share with you 7 mindset that keep most people poor. You see I have been bloke before, I was in debt I started with nothing  and I knew how it is to have no money so as I teach you I want you to figure it out so you will not repeat the same mistake that I did earlier on.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 1) Poor In Love </h4>
You see most of us, I believe we don’t love our self-enough and I don’t mean arrogance am talking about
Self-love, because when we were growing up we did not get love from other people for most of us, there is a guy that
I use to know who has experience multiple break-up and to a point now he doesn’t trust relationship any more he doesn’t trust woman anymore because he doesn’t want to get hurt and you can see on his face when I look at him he doesn’t smile there is no joy there is no life , but  think about this. If you have been given a choice that you can have a million dollars in the rest of your life in exchange that you could no longer have intimacy, love, happiness, and  you can no longer have relationship with any other else with an exchange of million dollars will you take it ? contact me with your comment. But probably you wouldn’t because life without love  means very  very little and there Is no joy in it and how can you give love ? you  can not give something you don’t  have so how can you give love if you don’t love or how can you give others love if you don’t love yourself. And so we remain poor because if I don’t love you I will never establish a business with my money and employee you so that you can be paid and have something to pay for your bills.

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2) Poor In Character </h4>
They lie cheat and steal they lack integrity they promise to do something and they don’t do it, and these people are the people that you can never trust them, you can’t rely on them they say they will back you and never back you poor in character. You see in this world everyone is fighting for him or herself but that doesn’t mean others should take advantage of others in the wrong way by cheating or being rude because by so doing it preclude the injured person from improving or moving from one step in life to the other and so they stay where they are and remain poor.

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3) Poor In Finance </h4>

They don’t like money, they don’t want to talk about money, they don’t know how to save money, they don’t know how to invest money and they even don’t know anything about money and therefore they have no money. But is not their problem but others too is due to ignorance. You know our education system is very poor, yes in all countries and I will boldly repeat that again. They don’t teach anything about money all what they know is study hard get a good grade so you can get a better job in the future they concentrate on how to work for money but not how to let money work for you. Check <a href="moneywork_foryou.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;"> CHECK HERE to see "how to let money work for you overnight whiles you sleep without ever working again" </a>
<br/>See the rich don’t work for money but our education system only teacher’s us how to work for money and does wrong but am not saying education is bad no but they just concentrate on active income instead of passive income so most of them with PhD degrees and others end up being poor why ?
Because they don’t know anything about money and so they will be poor forever.

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4) Poor In Habit </h4>
Their lazy, they procrastinate, they value comfort instead of freedom and success, they take drugs they smoke they drink. Stay away from these people you see you are a product of your environment you cannot help to be influence by the people around you, successful people they have better habit and that is it, so stay away from those people. There is a guy I know who is very hard working in life but always struggling in finance but he is working in a high paying company too, so what keeps him struggling ? You see this my friend all what he cares about is drinking, smoking and womanizing so after hard labor from work he will spend all his money on drugs, drinks and girls without thinking about investment and his own bills so he  always end up struggling to pay bills. Keep away from this kind of attitude if only you want to be rich in life.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5)Poor In Spirit </h4>
Do you know people who walk around all day just look defeated? They are saying to you why border trying they have lost hope may be they have been burnt before, they have failed before made mistakes before but now they have all given up. They will be saying to you all the time oo it can’t be done, it impossible hei don’t even try it I tried that before. You see just because they can’t do something now they are telling you why you can not do it either, their poor in spirit when they fail they don’t look for a way to improve on their failure to success but rather ending up thinking because they failed it can’t be done by anyone else so they remain at that same position and be poor forever but don’t be like them you were born to succeed not to fail but remember in the game of success in real life failure is the number one key you must know how to deal with in life. <a href="educatedendup_being_poor.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;">CHECK Here to see "how to overcome failures in the game of life"</a>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6)Poor In knowledge And Wisdom </h4>
<mark>Their people who are dumbed, their people who know their dumbed, their people who are dumbed thinking their smart and their people who are smart playing dumbed.</mark> Don’t be the fifth person, When am talking about wisdom am not talking about knowledge because knowledge does not equal wisdom and I don’t mean school smart and academic intelligence I mean something way more than that, because as a human being if you are talking to people that their not growing, not learning and not becoming better every single day will you talk to them? Contact me with your comment <mark>JusticeAnkomah12@getrichhome.com</mark>.
<br/>
You see when I mean people who are dumbed thinking their smart? I mean poor people who think they have the wisdom and knowledge about money and for that they don’t want to lean anything about money anymore. But remember the Bible even said “Lack Of Knowledge My people Perish” . Because most poor people don’t want to learn how actually money work and so they keep remaining poor forever. Don’t be like this people if you really want to succeed in life, always look for a way to learn how actually money works.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">7)Poor In Attitude </h4>
You see what is most contagious in life is not a positive attitude but rather a negative attitude these are the energy drainers, they drain the life out of you they suck the energy out of you whenever you have a conversation with them and after the conversation you feels like you need to take a shower to get ride of all their bullshit and negativity because they don’t say anything about money or success all their words are only just about negativity and they have no plan for the future nor to share some with you.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> In Summary </h4>
If you really want to succeed in life remember almost 90% of it depends on you and the 10% is on the society you live in so don’t be influence with those with the above mentioned mindset in life but always focus on your future plans and don’t let the fear of life overwhelmed you and remember God is with you and you will surely make it in life.
