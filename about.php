   <h5>hi my name is Justice Ankomah and am a web developer,graphic designer,and software engineer as well as a blogger</h5>
   <p>I started as a freelance web developer but turned my passion for programming into a full-time blogging career, but that doesn't mean i am not into programming any more ! no i really love coding and i will never give up on it. With the content I publish on Let’s Get Rich Home, I want to help you achieve financial independence through making money online so you can use that income to live your best life.</p>
   <P><img src="img/blog-img/justy.webp" style="border-radius:60%;width:20%;height: auto;"/></P>
   <p>Around 7 years ago I started reading about successful entrepreneurs, lifestyle designers, people making money online and quitting their day jobs to travel the world. It wasn’t anything I’d ever dream of doing with my life, but I kept reading.

        Over time, I realized it’s possible and it’s a matter of focused work. But that’s where most people get it wrong.</p>
        <h5>You need to actually put in the work (and do it for years) before you expect anything back (money, freedom, independence and all the other benefits).</h5>
        <p>Yes you have been hearing this quote all the time "Nothing sarcrifise Nothing Gain"! How do you understand this ? just think about it for a minute and if you thought it is about investing money to gain more then you are totally wrong so hands down. But perhaps is really about Time and how you manage it in exchange for something wealthy that can make you rich in the future. So what do i mean about that ? <br/>  See way back in 19 years since childhood I have been hearing of blogging, affiliate marketing, and e-books but I thought this was just supposed to be done by other type of people that was what was in my mind but I was totally wrong, yes my mind deceived me on that , but as a web developer  I always get a contract from client to develop blog for them but I never thought of developing some and managing it myself so I later got to realize how blog is monetized and I thought this could be a great way for making money in the future, it will rather take time, yes nothing good come’s easy but ones you don’t give up you will surely achieve it. <br/>
            I have been studying Robert kiyosaki the three times millionaire, Bill Gate  and Elon Musk and I have been applying their financial advice and is really wealth knowing how really money works, but I realize most people are struggling financially and don’t  have any financial education so I ended up creating a blog to help others make money online, be financially educated, and set small business. And most of the visitors here have been applying my rules here and others are really developing from $0 to $1000. I received a mail from most of the  visitors about how I been able to  change their life for the better with my articles. They mostly applied my passive income ideas <a href="passiveincome.php" style="color:blue; font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">here</a> check it out and  see how you can develop passive income for yourself overnight and start receiving $100 everday.
