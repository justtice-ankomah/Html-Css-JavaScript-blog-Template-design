        Steps For Getting rich slowly.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Do you want to become a Billionaire in future?
        <br/>
        <br/>
Well I will recommend you take the slow way instead of the quick way, because that is the best and the safe way of accumulating wealth. Most people dream of achieving financial freedom or getting rich overnight, But my brother or sister it doesn’t happened that way. Success is a tough road and it does take time, perhaps there are other ways of making money quick now adays, but the question is. 
<br/>
<br/>
Becoming rich by following get rich quick schemes ?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it safe?
<br/>
<br/>
NO. only few of them, but the majority out there are just after your money but not to make you rich, but hence in other for these get rich quick schemes to attract customers to take advantage of them. They pretend to be helping, but their main aim is to take what you have. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have been a victim of many of this schemes and trust me only one of it did worked for me and that was sport betting.
<br/>
<br/>
But ask me what have i been able to achieve with those monies that I won in sport betting ? and I will tell you they have collected it back 2*. So, who win ?, me or the owner of the betting company? they did. So since then I have leanrt my lessons never to follow those ways of getting rich, I prefer to go slowly.
<br/>

<br/>
Trust me, my life has changed now for better, since when I took that decision I have seen great difference, and is true  that, “slow motion is the safe way towards richness”, for how did it profit me for investing in ways that I knew nothing about and hence hoping for high interest in returns ?.
<br/>
<br/>
 I was spending all my earnings on gambling with the expectation of winning something big in the future not knowing that I was rather making the owners of those get rich schemes rich. Sometimes I will just walk in the casino with friends to do nothing than gambling. By the time that we should leave there, then I wouldn’t have spent not less than $50, sometimes $100 and above just hoping for big returns but none worked.
 <br/>
<br/>
So, if you had been able to read up to this section, better learn something from it and go rather by below slow ways that helped me to become successful in life. Don’t follow get rich quick schemes, remember shortcut often lead to long road, if you follow them with the expectation of getting rich, am afraid you might lose your money and delay your time of becoming rich. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I knew or someone had advised me on this, I would have been a trillionaire by now. Just imagine you spending $50 - $100 daily on placing casino bet. And hence I was in this game for more than 5 years. So, just check how much it did cost me in total of 1 year in this? what about investing this total? I guess you see how huge is it? I don’t want to do calculation for it because it just reminds me of how silly I was during my 20’s.
But unfortunately, you are lucky not to repeat the same mistake that I did.

Go with below ways of getting rich slowly that has helped me in becoming who I am today. 
</h5>
<br/>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1. (Save Money) Save 10% - 30% Of All Your Earning </h4>
For you to become rich you must create your own wealth, because wealth is created by all successful people. So Start saving at least 10% of all your earnings as a building blocks of Building wealth.
<p></p>
Just listen to this.
<p></p>
This was my first step that I took after deciding not to place casino bet again. So instead of me placing casino bet of $50 every single day I decided of saving this money in my bank account rather. But unfortunately, I lost a huge paying job of a company that I was working for in a gas explosion which caused the company to collapse, so I was only saving $200 monthly.
<p></p> 
But as slow as it may seem, I was really on my way of getting rich not quick by this time but slowly, hahaha. So, I had I call, 2 years after from my bank and they discussed with me about a bank shares that I had no idea about. But they explain it in a way that I became interested in what they said.
<p></p>
Do you Want to know What they discussed with me?
<p></p>
Well that is the next step below and I call it “the magical way of getting rich slowly with your money.”
<br/>

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2. Invest Your Savings (magical way of getting rich slowly)</h4>
<img src="img/blog-img/rich.webp" align="center" alt="getting rich slowly" style="padding: 10px;height:auto;">
<P></P>
So the Bank Manager discussed with me about “INVESTMENT”, but during the first 5 minute In our conversation I was not showing much interest in it so that made him threw a lot of point on what he was saying which made me agreed on it. And guest what he told me I can earn 15% Interest rates of my money with addition to my balance every 3 month, and if I want stock’s or bonds that can earn me 30% of interest every 3 month.
<p></p>
 So, I quickly confirmed my balance and seeing it. I said wow this is great "my money can now pay for my daily gambling of $50".
<p></p>
Hey, did I said am going to gamble $50 daily again?
<p></p>
No. what I mean is, with all the money that I have lost, if I buy bonds with my bank balance, I can recover all in just 2 years without me physically working to pay the price but my balance.
<p></p>
So, was I getting rich slowly by then?
<p></p>
No. I was getting rich quickly, I mean quick like an aircraft that has crashed from the sky and descending, so you guest the speed.
Why am I now  getting rich fast but not slowly? Let me explain
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

     data-ad-format="fluid"

<P></P>
You see what we humans; I mean me and you. What we don’t know is how money works, we hold money all the time, but we don’t know how money works.
<p></p>
Yes, you heard me but don't be offended. 
<p></p>
You don’t know how money work and don’t say you do, we all humans don’t, only few that has leant their lessons from it including me being the first “THE GAMBLER, $50+ DAILY WAISTER”.
<p></p> 
You see getting rich does start slowly and later becomes fast. Yes, that is one rule of building wealth, write it down so it can guide you all the time and always say to yourself “I started slowly but I will get rich quickly” yes you will. 
<p></p>
Take me as an example, I was making 30% with bank balance of $350,000+ monthly and hence found a new job that does pay for all my bills in an excess. So just imagine how much money I was making monthly, and not only that I do receive 30% on fixed balance the balance was increasing all the time so let say if I receive 30% of 100 which in addition to the actual balance equals 130 the next month I will not receive 30% on 100 but rather 130 and this does increase every month.
So here is the hint.
<p></p>
After saving 10% - 20% of all your earning for at least one year or even within 5 month you can start investing.
<P></P>
But maybe you will ask me this.
<p></p>
Hey how can I get 10% - 30% to save every month and later invest it?
<p></p>
Well your answer is the next step below here

<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3. Get a job </h4>

Hey Job? is that what you said
<p title="get rich slowly"></p>
Yes, that is exactly what I said 
<p title="get rich slowly"></p>
Get a job or do anything that can help you on your process of gaining financial independence or getting rich slowly. Because your goal here to earn something so that you can invest it, which will later grow big and make you get rich quick than going slowly than before.
<p></p>
But if you want to work online <a href="passiveincome.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;" title="passive income ideas">CHECK HERE to see "How I Make $500 monthly working online"</a>.
<p></p>
When it comes to getting rich, anything that does earn you money in exchange of your time is a job, be it online or offline. Working in both field can make you a lot of money but hence when it come’s to online money very few people knows how, but if you do google trending such analysis from 2012 -2020 “getting rich online” is the top trending search made by users, so imagine, people are tried to find ways to work online but their not willing to take action too.
<p></p>
But my problem is if online doesn’t work for you just go the traditional way of getting rich or making money (offline)

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5. Guide your money</h4>
Well done, you surely deserve.
<p></p>
First you have discipline yourself of saving at least 10% - 30% of all your savings, second you have double your money by investing it. 
Wow that is awesome, you are following the footstep all successful people and within few months to come you will start getting rich quick instead of going the slow way.
<p></p>
But let talk about this.
<p></p>
Do you think this money that you have invested in the bank safe?
<p></p>
Maybe you said yes. But if you did ask yourself this, If I wake up by tomorrow and hear and hear that this bank that you have invested huge money there had been burnt down by fire including all the bank workers what will I do.
<p></p>
Of course no one will think that for his or her on bank where he or she had saved huge amount of money there, but listen, as a student of money who is hopping to get rich in the future you shouldn’t accident or unnecessary act of your bank of any where you invest snatch your money away for you to lose anything.
<p></p>
So how will you guide your money then?
<p></p>
Is simple, instead of allowing your interest to grow for a very long time, go and discuss with your bank that whenever there is interest in your account they shouldn’t roll over the whole money for investment, but they should leave the interest in for you simple.
<p></p>
So here is what you should do with this interest that will be left in your account every month. Don’t leave it in the bank but rather cash out this money for business when is up to some amount that you are expecting. 
<p></p>
Just imagine starting a business with your bank balance interest! it sounds awesome right?
Well it is I have two of these all with my interest.
<p></p>
So, with these anything that happens with your bank you won’t end up begging for food but to have your business to fall back on. And if nothings happen huraiiii just keep getting rich quickly not slowly.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6. (Spend Less) Pay Attention To Unnecessary Expenses </h4>
Hmm this is a big problem with most successful people who has successfully achieved financial independence. But for them we will say they’re on financially independent, so they are spending on unnecessary things, and they deserve too.
<p></p>
But what of you who just started getting rich slowly?
<p></p>
Don't you have to apply the law of Money management ?
<p></p>
Should you go to the bank and take all your investment and flip it on girls Or guys?
<p></p>
Well I think you should do if only you don’t know where you are heading to. But we the rest of us who knows where we are getting to, we will not. For what does it mean to be spending your monthly earnings on things that you don’t actually need and hence making these things expenses or liabilities on your head?
