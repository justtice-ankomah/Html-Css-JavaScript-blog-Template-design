<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 1. Sacrifice the Shining Objects </h4>
for more than a decade after i made a decision to become rich, i didn't buy any shining  object i didn't buy the latex phone, tv, shoes
or cloth. I bought nothing for my existence or my business. 
<br/>
my idea about money is "make it, invest it and manage anything that remains. I had days where me and my wife were block, we were block
because we invested almost everything  we had  earn for the past years, i won't tell you that it is easy but is a sarcrifice that is wealthy.
<br/>
Would you rather be a lion one day and be respected all days of your life or would you rather be a sheep with no honour ?.
<br/>
 would you rather sacrifice those new phones, clothes, wrist watches and be an average man the rest of your life ?
<br/>
robert kiyosaki said "poor people buy luxuries first while rich people buy luxuries last"   If you want to be rich you
must be decipline enough to sacrifice the shinning object. Invest a specific percentage of your income and manage whatever is left.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2. Sacrifice The Friendship With Poor People</h4>
I decided long ago never to be friend with poor people and what i mean by poor people here isn't those people who don't have any
money. The truely poor people are those who are  not ambitious.
<br/>
                    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script>
<br/>
If you hang out with people who are not ambitious you won't be ambitious. If you hang out with people who make excusses you will
end up making excusses. if you hang out with people who expect the economy to be better before they will be rich you will
do the same.
<br/>
let go of negetive people surround yourself with positive and ambitious people and you will be rich because they know how to acquire wealth and also 
top things to sacrifice in life to become rich, they will also challenge and encourage 
you to do big things in life.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3. Sacrifice the social media and Tv </h4>
I never bought a TV set in my entire life "hahahaah", i had only one social media account and got it deleted last year november. Today i use social media
strictly for business, and here is the reason. Social media, like the Tv is too interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
if you want to be rich you will be careful about things that are too interesting because if anything is too interesting and it doesn't give you money then is taking
away money from you. The reason why you can spend 7 hours infront of the TV set is because is so interesting, the reason why you can check your facebook account
5 hours a day is because is so interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the real thing is bitter. If you want to be rich you have to spend your time doing things, not enjoying sweet things, action is difficult
but bitter, and that is what you have to do. Do i mean you should delete all your social media account? "NO"  Do i mean you should reduce the number of
hours you spend infront of the TV ? "YES"  If only you want to be rich .

<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4. Sacrifice Some Sleep </h4>
This is one of the best investments you can make to make your life more productive and rewarding. Most people do not need more than 6 hours to maintain an excellent state of health.
<br/>
<br/>
Try getting up one hour earlier for 21 days and it will develop into a powerful habit. Remember, it is the quality not the quantity of sleep that is important. And just imagine having an extract
30 hours a month to spend on the things that are important to you.

Am not talking about the bullshit of waking up early 5:00am here, nobody needs to wake up at 4:00am or 5:30am as a rule. The rule to richness is simple
you need to sleep later than most people or wake up earlier than most people, am not saying that you should sleep only 3 hours at night but i don't think you have
to sleep 9 hours either.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5. Sacrifice The Blame Game </h4>
I grew up in a society where most people blame the government the economy or their parent for their poverty however when i was around 17 i decide to stop that 
nonsense. Blaming people for your failure isn't right because you have the feeling and strength to make things work for yourself and being dependent on yourself
is the best thing to achieve in life.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this mindset is that since you think is not your fault you also thinks someone else should help you out be the government, your parent, or the economy.
<br/>
<br/>
am sorry no body is going to help you to become rich. If you want to be rich you will sacrifice the pleasure you are getting from blaming other people, you will
take 100% responsibility for your life "get out and get your hands dirty and make your dreams a reality".

The day i was going to the business world was very remarkable, i was afraid yet i knew i just had to do something with my life. At some point i was not sure i 
could succeed but i told myself i will rather die now than to live the rest of my life as a poor perpon.
<br/>
<br/>
 If you want to be rich you will be crazy enough to let 
go of your feelings, the truth if wether you step out or not you will fail because failure is part of life. Why going through in life with fear while you can face your
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">7. Sacrifice Your Impatience</h4>
Warren Buffet said " you can not have a baby by next month by impregnating a woman today"
<br/>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

<br/>
That is very true, good things always take time, most of the overnight success you see actually happens over 1000 of night. You can be rich but it woun't 
happen next month, it can not happen next 3 month so stop being impatience, stop looking for get rich quick, stop looking for short cut because it usually leads
to a longer journey.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">8. Give up your low self esteem</h4>
The evidence that you can achieve something is the fact that many people who were born in similar situation like you have achieved such a thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Low self esteem is when you think you are not capable of not becoming rich, low self esteem is when you pity yourself, low self esteem is when you think you can't 
be rich when the economy is bad. Sacrifice that ,don't give up, pick up a new you, you are capable of changing the world.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">9. Give Up Your hatred For Reading Books</h4>

I started reading financial books when i was around 17. I never stop since then, Listen, school won't teach you how to be rich unfortunately because financial
education isn't part of our education syllabus, the only teachers you can depend on for your financial freedom are those who had made good money and financial books.
<br/>
<br/>
You really need a miracle to become rich if you don't read financial books written by people who had become rich over time "am sorry"
<br/>
give up your hatred for reading books, reading financial books and applying the concerpt in it can make you rich.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">10. Give Up The Easy Life </h4>
In all the dream of easy life is a mix. Life isn't easy and it is not going to be "am sorry" give up the hope for easy life, give up the expectation that you should be rich 
easily, Be willing to pay the price or you won't get rich.
<br/>
<br/>
 Get up and do something hard to change your life and remember without change in life your life will
remains where it use to be becuase there is a saying that goes " without change there is no progress".

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">11. You Must Have A Mission Statement In Life</h4>
This is simply a set of guiding principles which clearly state where you are going and where you want to be at the end of your life. A mission statement
embodies your values. It is your personal lighthouse keeping you steadily on the course of your dreams. 
<br/>
<br/>
Over a period of one month, set a few hours aside to write down five or ten
principles which will keep you focused at all times. Examples might be to consistently serve others, to be a considerate citizen, to  become highly wealthy or to serve as a 
powerful leader. Whatever the mission statement of your life, refine it and review it regularly. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then when something adverse happens or someone tries to pull you off course, 
you quickly and precisely return to your chosen path with the full knowlodge that you are moving in the direction that you have selected

If you really want to succeed in life remember almost 90% of it depends on you and the 10% is on the society you live in so don’t be influence with those with the above mentioned mindset in life but always focus on your future plans and don’t let the fear of life overwhelmed you and remember God is with you and you will surely make it in life.
