<br/>
   You see in my blog getrichhome.com here I talk a lot about success, mindset, business ideas, poor, entrepreneurship
and wealth creation. And one of the thing I keep saying again and again and that is,
<br/>
<br/>
 <mark>“Don’t Hang Around With Poor People”</mark> 
<br/>
<br/>
 And some people take it the wrong way, ooo there you always judge people character by how much money they make and save, 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "no does not what I mean" 
<br/>
<br/>
Because people without money! that’s just one form of poor. There are  many forms of poor but today am going to share with you "7 Mindset that will make you poor". You see I have been broke before, I was in debt, i started with nothing  and i knew how it is to have no money. So as i teach you, i want you to figure it out, so that you will not repeat the same mistake i did earlier on.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 1) Poor In Love </h4>
You see most of us, I believe we don’t love our self-enough and i don’t mean arrogance, am talking about
Self-love, because when we were growing up we couldn't get love from other people for most of us, there is a guy that
i use to know who has experienced multiple break-up's, and to a point now he doesn’t trust relationship any more, he doesn’t trust woman anymore, because he doesn’t want to get hurt, and yes you can see on his face when you look at him, he doesn’t smile, there is no joy, there is no life.
<p></p>
But  think about this !. 
<p></p>
If you have been given a choice that. You can have a million dollars in the rest of your life in exchange that, you could no longer have intimacy, love, happiness, and  you can no longer have relationship with any other else with an exchange of million dollars 
<p></p>
Will you take it ? 
<p title="7 mindset that will make you poor"></p>
contact me with your comment. But probably you wouldn’t because life without love  means very  very little and there is no joy in it, and how can you give love ? you can't give something you don’t  have. So how can you give love if you don’t love or how can you give others love if you don’t love yourself ?. 
<p></p>
And so we remain poor.
<p></p>
Because if i don’t love you, But i rather have a poor or bad mindset about you. I will never establish a business with my money and employee you, so that you can be paid and have something to pay for your bills.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2) Poor In Character </h4>
They lie, cheat and steal, they have poor mindset, they promise to do something and they don’t do it.
<p title="7 mindset that will make you poor"></p>
 And these people, are the once that you can never trust them, you can’t rely on them they say they will back you and never back you, poor in character and mindset. 
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
 You see in this world everyone is fighting for him or herself, but that doesn’t mean others should take advantage of others in the wrong way, by cheating or being rude. Because by so doing, it preclude the injured person from improving or moving from one step in life to the other and so they stay where they are and remain poor.

<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">3) Poor In Finance </h4>

<span style="color:orange">They don’t like money,
<br/>they don’t want to talk about money, 
<br/>they don’t know how to save money, 
<br/>they don’t know how to invest money
<br/>
and they even don’t know anything about money 
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>And therefore they have no money. </span>
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
But is not their problem, but others too is due to ignorance. 
<br/>
You know our education system is very poor, yes in all countries and I will boldly repeat that again. 
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
They don’t teach anything about money,
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
 All what they know is, study hard, get a good grade, so that you can get a better job in the future. They concentrate on how to work for money, but not how to let money work for them. 
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
 Check <a href="moneywork_foryou.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;"> CHECK HERE to see "how to let money work for you overnight whiles you sleep without ever working again" </a>
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
See, the rich don’t work for money, but our education system only teacher’s us how to work for money and does wrong, but am not saying education is bad, no but they just concentrate on active income instead of passive income.
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
 So most of them with PhD degrees and others later end up being poor why ?
<p title="minset of the poor"></p>
Because they don’t know anything about money, and so they remain on government insurance during their retirement. And if their insurance paycheck is not enough they begin to suffer and hence join the poor.
<p title="minset that will make you poor"></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4) Poor In Habit </h4>
Their lazy, they procrastinate, they value comfort instead of freedom and success, they take drugs they smoke they drink. Stay away from these people,
<p title="minset"></p>
 See, you are a product of your environment, you cannot help to be influence by the people around you. Successful people, they have better habit and that is it, so stay away from those people. There is a guy i know who is very hard working in life but always struggling in finance, but he is working in a high paying company too.
<p title="minset"></p>
  so what keeps him struggling ?
<p title="poor"></p>
  You see this my friend, he has a poor mindset. All what he cares about is drinking, smoking and womanizing. So after hard labour from work he will spend all his money on drugs, drinks and girls without thinking about investment and his own bills. So he  always end up struggling to pay bills. Keep away from this kind of people with poor and bad mindset if only you want to be rich in life.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5)Poor In Spirit </h4>
Do you know people who walk around all day just look defeated? 
<p title="minset"></p>
They will say to you, 
<p title="minset"></p>
Why border trying? they have lost hope may be they have been burnt before, they have failed before made mistakes before but now they have all given up. They will be saying to you all the time, it can’t be done, it impossible, hey don’t even try it, i tried that before and it didn't work. 
<p title="7 mindset that will make you poor"></p>
You see just because they can’t do something, now they are telling you why you can not do it either, their poor in spirit, when they fail they don’t look for a way to improve on their failure to success but rather ending up thinking because they failed it can’t be done by anyone else. 
<p title="7 mindset that poor"></p>
So they remain at that same position and be poor forever but don’t be like them you were born to succeed not to fail but remember in the game of success in real life failure is the number one key you must know how to deal with. <a href="educatedendup_being_poor.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;">CHECK Here to see "1 secrete to overcome failures in life "</a>

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6)Poor In knowledge And Wisdom </h4>
<mark>Their people who are dumbed, who know their dumbed, who are dumbed thinking their, and people who are smart playing dumbed.</mark>
<p title="7 mindset that will make you poor"></p>
 Don’t be the fifth person.
<p title="poor"></p>
  When am talking about wisdom, am not talking about knowledge because knowledge does not equal wisdom and i don’t mean school smart and academic intelligence. I mean something way more than that, because as a human being if you are talking to people and their not changing mindset, not learning, not becoming better every day, will you talk to them? Contact me with your comment <mark>JusticeAnkomah12@getrichhome.com</mark>.
<p title="mindset"></p>
When i mean people who are dumbed thinking their smart? 
<p title="7 poor  people"></p>
I mean poor people who think they have the wisdom and knowledge about money, and for that they don’t want to learn anything about money anymore. But remember the Bible even said “Lack Of Knowledge My people Perish”. 
<p title="7 mindset that will make you poor"></p>
Because most poor people doesn't want to learn how actually money work they keep remaining poor forever. Don’t be like these people if you really want to succeed in life, always look for a way to learn how actually money works.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">7)Poor Or Bad Attitude </h4>
What is most contagious in life is not a positive attitude, but rather a negative attitude, poor mindset, these are the energy drainers, they drain the life out of you, they suck the energy out of you, whenever you have a conversation with them and after the conversation you feels like you need to take a shower to get ride of all their bullshit and negativity;
<p title="poor people mindset"></p>
 Because they don’t say anything about money or success, all their words are only just about negativity and they have no plan for the future nor to share some with you.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> In Summary </h4>
If you really want to succeed in life remember almost 90% of it depends on you and the 10% is on the society you live in. so don’t be influence with those with the above mentioned poor mindset.
<p title="poor people mindset that drains people"></p>
 But always focus on your future plans and don’t let the fear of life overwhelmed you, and remember God is with you, and you will surely make it in life.
