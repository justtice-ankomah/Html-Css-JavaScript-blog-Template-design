<div id="headdiv" style="padding:20px;background-color:#f2f2f2;border-radius:10px;">
<p>There are so many ways to get rich quick or become wealthy fast in life. Most people’s dream of becoming rich all the time but only few of them actually makes it. But answer me; do you think those who actually make it were destined to be rich? </p>
 <p>I don’t believe in such thing. Is true that most people born into a rich family will surely become rich in the future. But that does not mean they were destined to be, no. In fact the truth about this question is, each and every one has the right to become rich but you can only make it if you have the guts to be. Yes, that it is simple, if you really want to become rich and you really want to, why not fight for it? </p>
 <p>You don’t have to let anything stop you from getting rich because that what you really want to be. Dan lok once said “There will be a result for whatever you are doing today” so if you really work hard on your goals there is no fact that you won’t succeed in life. </p>
 <p>One problem I see most people facing is that, they like wishing a lot without taking action. If you dream of buying a car next year and you don’t work on it you will never have it unless is by miracle. So do you see why most people never become rich in life? They wish a lot without taking any action. We all have dreams but only those who have the guts to work hard on it will make it. </p>

 </p>

 <p>This is simple to understand because if we just wish and it becomes reality then everyone would have been rich buy now. Because I don’t think there is anyone on this planet who dreams of becoming poor. No, I have never heard it in the news or anywhere around. So if our wishes just do happen the movement we thought of then I thinks there won’t be any need for work either. </p>
 <p>Because all the jobs that we are doing we are actually doing it for survival. So if we can just command our needs to happen by wishing it then we would have done so easily. We will never bother seeking for work because if we need $200,000 now we will just command it and it will be in our bank account in minute. </p>
 <p>But the sad part is, that is not how things are. You need to fight or work for anything you want before you can have it. So if you are not willing to work or to take any action then don’t even dream of becoming rich unless by a miracle. But don’t worry you don’t have to work that hard to become successful. </p>
 <p>In below step by step guide I will show you 15 ways to get rich quick without working hard. </p>
 <p>So let get to it… </p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">
1.	Invest Your Money to Become rich
 </h2>
<p>This is what the rich use to beat the poor. Whiles poor people’s focus on saving, rich people invest. There is sense in it too because whenever you leave your money at the bank it reduces it value due to inflation. But what if you invest it? Will it loose it value? no. It will yield interest which can be accumulated to a huge wealth. </p>
 <p>Suppose you leave $100 in the bank for 10 years, what will happen? The value will reduce to $0 if inflation becomes high. So there is a big sense in investing instead of saving. One advantage of investing is that it serves as a passive income. Investment is what most rich peoples are into now. We all know of Warren Buffet who made his fortune through investment. Buffet started investing in his childhood because his father was a financial adviser so he was learning from him all the time. </p>
 <p>That is one thing about investment, the earlier you start the faster your money grows. So focus on investing your money. There are so many ways you can invest, be it in business, stocks or by buying shares and treasury bills. </p><p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
</p>

 <p>One easy way you can start is to begin by buying treasury bills from local developing financial institutions. There are other businesses who also sell treasury bills aside financial institutions. But I will recommend you buy from local banks because is much safer than the others. One thing you should also know is that, you have to invest wisely in a way that you have much knowledge about. </p>
 <p>Yes, whiles you may think investing is just about putting your money into business to attract a certain percentage rate of interest. If you don’t do it wisely you will end up losing all your money. Don’t be bother to ask me how. Just wait for me to explain okay. Just imagine you know a well-known growing company in your community and decided to invest all past 20 years earning into it. What will you do when you wake up one day and hear in the news that the company is collapsed? Or it has been burnt down due to fire explosion? </p>
 <p>All your monies will be gone so invest wisely. Before you decide to invest in a particular business make sure you have made a lot of research about the business on how it is growing. Also pay attention to business terms and conditions. There are other businesses that will give you a certain percentage of your principal in case anything goes wrong. Others too does not because each because has it own terms and conditions regard to investing. </p>
 <p>Among this list of ways to get rich quick, above is the one that I want you to learn more about it before you get into. </p>

2. Associate Rich Peoples
</h2>
 <p>You have probably heard of this saying before “Your network is your net wealth” </p>
 <p>Yes, if you really want to know the various ways to get rich quick then this what you can’t do without. If you surround yourself with rich peoples they will guide and help you to become rich because they know the pattern much more than you do. They will also show you the simple root to take. This is because for them they have failed in many ways when they first began their journey to success. </p>
 <p>They have a lot of experience, so they will surely teach you the right path to take in other not to repeat the same mistakes that they did earlier on. So try and associate with the rich peoples in your society. Don’t be shy of being close to them; their doors are open looking for others to enter for advice. If you are shy you can simple do this over the internet on various social media platforms. </p>
 <p>Go to <a href="facebook.com">Facebook</a> or <a href="twitter">Twitter</a> and join most of the groups there. You may find someone who is rich already that you can friend with, if you don’t want to do this offline. </p>
 <p>If you really want to get rich quick then the need to associate with rich peoples should be important to you. Just look at this brief example below concerning this guide. </p><p>

 <p>John is just a college graduate who has just landed on his dream job. He has heard that, in other for him to become rich fast. He must invest his savings instead of leaving it at the bank. There is a lot of successful investors in his community but John never seek advice from any of them. He moved out one morning and invested all his past earnings into a growing business. </p>
 <p>Within the next 3 month John heard from the news that the business is collapsed due to poor management. What will you do if you were to be in the shoes of John? May be you will swear in your life that you will never invest in any business again. Yes that is what you say may, but remember that the problem wasn’t form the company it was Jon’s fault. If he would have sought advice from other investors in his community, they would have educated him to make a research about any business before he tries to invest in. </p>
 <p>So you see, in case John plan to invest again there will surely be a delay in his journey to success. Because he has wasted some years already and if he doesn’t sought for advice his chances of failing again is really high. But suppose he associate with the rich persons in his society and seek their advice. He will surely become rich quick because they will guide him with their experience. </p>

 <h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">

3.	Have Multiple Sources of Income
 </h2>
<p>Having 2 or 3 sources of income will surely make you rich quick. Suppose you have only one source of income, let say from your current job. Just ask yourself how long will it take for you to save $2 million? It will surely take you almost 30 years if your monthly income is $200 and you try to save $100 monthly. So you, see how long this will take? But I don’t think is the best option for you if you want to get rich quick. </p>
 <p>Instead of depending on a single source of income why not make it two or even three? </p><p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
</p>

 <p>There are so many ways you can generate money from as a second source of income. Some include: </p>
 <p><ul><li><span style="color:darkorange";>Part Time-Jobs: </span>  If your current job allows you to have much time to spend doing nothing. Then why not utilize this time to earn some time? You can search for a part time-job that will allow you to work together with your current job. Ask your friends if they know of any part-time job that you can get into. </li>
<li><span style="color:darkorange";>YouTube Channel: </span> Do you know YouTube paid over $6+ million to its content creators in 2017 alone? Yes, they did in case you don’t know. What do you think those who got their share of this money did? Did they swept the whole Google company for that year? No, all what they did was creating videos. So if you want to make some money with your spare time then consider starting a YouTube channel. </li>
<li><span style="color:darkorange";>Start a blog:  </span> They say blogging takes time before you can make money with it right? </li></ul></p>
 <p>Wrong</p>
 <p>You have been lied. If you know nothing about blogging then it can take you almost 3 years before you can make a cent. But if you take your time and learn about SEO, guest blogging and other tips. It shouldn’t take you 6 month before you should start earning.  I have sold almost 12 successful blogs over the past. But guest what it took me 4 month to work on each before I list them for sale on flipper. My secret is that am an SEO specialist and a computer programmer so I know how to drive traffic to my online business. </p>
 <p>So start a blog and make money with it. In case you need help you can reach me on justiceankomah12gmail.com </p>

 <p>Okay let move on to the forth way of getting rich quick…</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">

4.	Take Risk to Build Wealth
 </h2>
<p>I was told by a friend of mine never to involve myself in risk taking.  So I made my mind that I will never stake a lottery or go to the casino ever in my life. But I didn’t know the real fact. Because I was advised by my friend I got a bad mindset about risk taking. I never took my time to conduct a research myself. </p>
 <p>What I didn’t know was, if you really want to know the various ways to get rich quick then risk is something you shouldn’t ignore. `Most people fail in risk taking simply because they don’t know the principles regards to it. </p>
 <p>Risk is something that you must get into. You don’t have to have a fear of losing. What you don’t know is, you should only take risk with your spare money. That is the main rule of taking risk. Because you cannot predict the right outcome of any game classified as risk, you shouldn’t do so with your savings. Instead do it with money you have set aside for nothing. </p>
 <p>There are a lot of people who had become rich due to their involvement in risk taking. So if someone tells you not to take risk is probably because such person had failed before in it. So you see, because he failed he thinks you can’t make it either. But remember that “If someone says you can’t. They’re telling you their limits not yours” </p><p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5717443157632535"
     data-ad-slot="3339034469"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
</p>

 <p>So don’t let them defeat you. Just apply the principles that I have shown you and you will make it. There are a lot of peoples who had made a fortune in risk taking, but tell me what makes them different from the rest us? Is simple, they invest wisely with their spare money not their savings. </p>
 <p>If you think risk taking is something that you shouldn’t involve yourself in, then don’t involve yourself in investment too. Because among all the risk taking out there investment is one of the greatest risk. If you don’t believe this, then call Warren Buffet right now and tell him you want to get into investment and just listen to the first question he will ask you. “Have you learned the principles regards to investing?” </p>
 <p>He will ask you that because he knew very well, that if you don’t invest wisely you will end up losing all your money. So now, tell me the difference here. If you don’t invest wisely you will lose your money. And if you don’t take risk wisely too you will lose your money. I hope you have gotten the concept right. In both cases you can lose if you don’t do it wisely. So see risk taking just as investment and take risk. </p>

 <p>The next tip is what I am into right now and is one of my ways of getting rich quick. </p>
 <p>Let explore it…</p>
 
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">

5.	Get Rich By Owning Your Own Business
 </h2>
<p>Have you ever thought of owning your own business? </p>
 <p>Then go for it because is a great way of becoming rich quick or successful in life. You don’t have to be instructed all the time by your boss to do this and that. You will also have the guts to instruct other employee by establishing your own business. </p>
 <p>In fact owning your own business is really a reasonable decision you must take. What most business owners don’t and won’t tell you as an employee is that. All your hard working in a particular job. The boss of it get the highest share almost 10* your monthly paycheck. And what do these business owners do for this huge money monthly? </p>
  <p>They do nothing, most of them have their managers running the business for them. So they don’t involve themselves in running of the business and yet they’re the ones that get paid the most. </p><p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"

</p>

 <p>So if you have the guts and the capital to start your own business go for it. Your chances of succeeding in owing your own business is much higher than working 9-5 for someone else. </p>

List all your monthly expenses on the right side and your earnings on the left side. Make sure the total of your earnings is 2* the total value of your expenses. Subtract the total value of the expenses from your earnings and whatever result you get, take 10% out of it for emergency fund and save the rest. </p>
 <p>This way, you will have something to fall back on all the time in case of any emergency. You will also be able to save something monthly for your future. </p>
 <p>So live on budget and once you are doing it don’t forget to…</p>

7.	Work hard
 </h2>
<p>There is a saying that goes “In other to be successful you got to have a great talent” yes we all know that most people with great talent are successful. While being talented can make you rich there is also a saying that goes “Hard work beat talent” </p>
 <p>So if you are not blessed with great talents don’t think you can’t become rich, no. Just focus and keep working hard on your goals and remember what I told you earlier on “There will be a reward for whatever you are doing” So work hard on your goals. But please I don’t mean you should involve yourself in in violent works that will make you rich quick, no. Such works can get you killed easily. </p>
 <p>Arm rubbing is a great work to do if you want to get rich quick. Just imagine, rubbing your neighbors with all their past 30 years earning in just one day, and putting it into your bank account.  It sounds great and a good work to become rich fast right? </p>
 <p>Wrong. </p><p>

 <p>Okay now among this list of ways to get rich quick. </p>
 <p>If there is anything you want to focus on to become rich, then it should be this one… </p>
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">

8. Focus on Creating Passive Income
 </h2>
<p>Let me explain what a passive income and active income is in case this is your first time of hearing it. </p>
 <p><ul><li><span style="color:darkorange";>Passive income </span> is anything that put money in your pocket without you physically working for it. Example includes interest on investment, earnings on Asset. </li>
<span style="color:darkorange";>Active Income </span> is anything that put money in your pocket which requires you to physically or actively work for it. Example includes working 9-5 and no work no pay jobs. </li> </ul></ </p>
  <p>So comment below, among these two which one will you focus your time on?   </p>
 <p>If you really want to be financially independents and have much time to spend with your family and friends. Then passive income is what you should focus on creating. With passive income you will still get paid even if you don’t work. And tell me who want to work 9-5 the rest of his or her life? No one right? Yes unless may be you just like working but probably almost 90% of the world will say no. </p>
 <p>They will say no not just because their lazy and they hates working, no. The reality is, we all humans’ needs to rest when we get to certain age in life. So within this resting time, there should be some form of earnings we should get to pay for all our needs without us actively working. That is where passive income comes in “money earn without physically working for its” </p><p>

 <p>So focus on building passive income instead of active income. Because with active income it just works like “No work no pay” if you don’t work for it you won’t get it. It will not allow you to have time with your family too, because you will be busy working all the time. But one advice I will give you is that, whiles working paycheck to paycheck. Consider converting your earnings into passive income by investing it or starting a business with it. </p>
 <p>You don’t have to work 9-5 for the rest of your life in exchange for a pay check. So convert your active income earnings into passive income so that if you retire you can have something to fall back on. </p>
 <p>You are about to see the best ways to get rich quick, that can make you successful in short time. </p>

12.	 Invest in yourself
 </h2>
<p>Do you know why most peoples are rich and others are poor? </p>
 <p>Is lack of personal investing, let me give you a simple example about this. </p>
 <p>Janet and Susana are very good friends. They all have a dream of establishing their own business over the internet. But in other for them to make this dream a reality they both need a laptop each. So Mercy has planned to buy a laptop with 30% of her past earnings. Whiles Mercy has this idea in mind Janet keeps blaming his parent of not being able to buy her a laptop. </p>
 <p>Mercy has bought her laptop and currently he had landed on a big online business she is planning of purchasing it. Two month later she talked to the owner of the business and paid for it with her past earnings. </p>
 <p>Whiles Mercy currently owns his dream online business Janet keeps blaming his parent of a laptop. </p><p>

13. Think of Big Ideas
 </h2>
<p>You have probably heard of this wise saying before “Your inner world create your outer world” </p>
 <p>Hey, do you mean am just the way I am because of the world inside me? </p>
 <p>Yes, you have heard it right and it is exactly what I mean. If you want to become rich you need to get rid of the poor mentality and start thinking of bigger ideas. I hope you know of Elon Musk the space man? Do you know what made him so rich and successful? </p>
 <p>It is because he thinks of bigger ideas. Do you think, if he has been thinking like that poor neighbor who is next to you, would he has gotten to where he is now? Absolutely no, he is wealthy because of his mindset. So if I say “your outer world, create your inner world” I actually mean whatever you think in your head if is a big dream that is exactly what you will achieve if you work on it. And if is a small or poor dream that is exactly who you will be in the future. </p>
 <p>So think of big ideas it is the best guide on becoming rich and successful in life. </p>

14. Cut down Your Expenses
 </h2>
<p>I hope you know what is meant by expenses? </p>
 <p>Well, if you don’t understand let me explain is simple, you don’t need to have a genius mind like Albert Einstein to understand. </p>
 <p>An expense simply means anything that takes money away from your pockets, well known as liabilities. So base on this definition do you think you can become rich whiles you keep taking out money from your pocket all the time instead of putting something in? </p>
 <p>Surely no, you do need to cut down the amount of monies that get out from your pockets. The best way you can do this is to list down all your expenses. Then look through it very well and remove or cut down any expense that is irrelevant to you. All expenses are categorized into two part, fixed expenses and flexible expenses. </p>
	<p><ul><li><span style="color:darkorange";>Fixed Expense: </span> Their cost that is always the same example includes your renting bills or car payment.  </li>
<li>
	<span style="color:darkorange";>Flexible Expenses: </span> Their cost that varies or changes month after month example includes cost on food, gas and groceries. </li></ul></p>

15.  Get a Good Job to Become Rich Quick
</h2>
 <p>Do you know that the fact that you are working in a particular job does not mean that you will surely become rich? </p>
 <p>Yes if you think it then think of it again. </p>
 <p>Imagine two peoples with same qualification let say bachelor in accounting and also let call them James and Peter. They have both landed on their dream job as an accountant but there is one problem. Despite the fact that they are all working their pay check is different hence they are with the same qualification. While Peter is being paid $200 monthly James monthly pay check is only $100. </p>
 <p>So guess what, whom among these two friends do you think he will have much money to save? </p><p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"

<p><a href="worldremit-mobile-money.php" style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;font-size:20px;">Check Also:: "worldremit richard igoe mobile money "</a></p>

 <p>It is surely James. So go for the right job that pays well so that you can get something to save. It doesn’t make sense to live paycheck to paycheck and have nothing to save for your future. If you are working for a company and you had nothing to save for your future monthly, the best advice I will give you is to talk to your boss for payment increase. If he doesn’t agree for increments then you got to look for another job. </p>
 <p>Because the main purpose of working 9-5 is to convert those earnings into passive income. So if you don’t get anything to save monthly, then what are you going to invest as a passive income to fall back on when you grow old? </p>
 <p>So go for the right job that you can get something to save monthly. </p>
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">

Final Thought on Ways to Get Rich Quick
 </h2>
<p>With all this ways to get rich quick, remember what I always advice you on. “Get The Action Habit” Because if you don’t take any action with any of it you will never become rich. The fact that you know these ideas does not mean you will be successful, no. In other for you to see the result of it you need to implement it. The best way to do it is to take action. </p><p>
