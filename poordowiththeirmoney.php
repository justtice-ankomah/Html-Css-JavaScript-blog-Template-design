	<h5 style="color:darkorange; padding:20px;background-color:#f2f2f2;border-radius:10px;">
    The poor and the rich are all human beings but what separate this two parties is what they does with their monies. Most Poor peoples are well known as money squanders and the rich is refereed as investors, So are poor Peoples really money squanders that they spend money in a way that they actually don’t think about it ? Well Here is a list of 7 things that poor people does with their money that makes the rich thinks  their money squanders.
    </h5>
	<h4  style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">1) Gambling </h4>
Other things that poor people spend their money on is Gambling! I know you might be saying that’s not me, but if you go and step into the casino and look at the hundreds of people there just spending thousands of dollars every single month in gambling you will realize what am talking about. But it doesn’t happen only in the casino no it happens in the lottery, sport betting and it happens in many games as people play on one on one as a team or whatever it is, poor people gamble their money because that’s all what they know how to do. <br/>
Now there are many reasons why most of the people gamble but to them none of them know where their money is going.  But the main reason is because is a throw or adventure to know that you just played $100 on sport betting and you may be getting $200 back. They feel like they have more chances of winning than losing and that’s why their willing to forsake that money in gambling.

<br/>
<h5 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> How To Avoid Gambling </h5>
Get yourself from places or peoples that support gambling.  For instance if you are driving on the road and you see a convenience store, don’t go in there because you know you are going to buy 10 Lottery ticket, or if a  friend is calling that Hei  won’t you come and place your bet today ? Tell him no you are no more into betting again and if this continues they will stop calling you for betting.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">2)BRAGGING </h4>
Look if 	you are not humble about the little money that you make then what makes you think you will be humble about the big money that you may get? Unless you are honest in the small ones you won’t be host in the large ones, so take care of the little responsibility of the finances that you have now so you can gain greater responsibility of the finances that you want in the future, but most of the poor people don’t understand this and always bragging and chilling with any little money they get and not realizing that small drops of water makes a mighty ocean
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;"> 3) Vacation</h4>
A lot of people thinks that they need a vacation and  yes they do but if they don’t have the money  to spend all their money on vacation that is where the tragedy begins. For instance I know a  lot of people that like to take courses and look for deals and they put it into business that they can invest in this vacation so as to escape their jobs and have the ultimate joy of their lives. So be aware of this vacations you might think you may get a deal in it but make sure you don’t end up spending all your money on a single vacation.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">4) Get-Rich Quick Schemes </h4>
Now What am basically saying is that poor people have this mentality that they can get rich fast because most of the people around them are rich, they think that if they put $1000 in network marketing or some business that they think is going to generate income you will automatically make million dollars but that is not how it works my friend. Because the people who are making this get rich quick scheme already know that there are multitude of people that are desperately waiting to multiply their money, they know that peoples are going to spend thousand dollars in a hopes of getting million dollars in return. <br/>
So be aware of this get rich quick schemes and ask yourself is this something that I really want to do ? or is this something that is going to help me to become a greater person and help other peoples along the way ?. I will give you a clear example ! When I graduated from high school I managed to make a lot of money and decided to join a network marking firm which thought me a lot of lessons and eventually cost me thousands and thousands of dollars, ultimately I realize that it was a trap, I have to pay for the conferences, pay for the meetings, pay for the supplies and I have to false myself to meet people that I didn’t necessary want to meet to sell a product that I never believed. <br/>
Now what am actually saying is beware of these schemes and yes it takes money to make money but make sure that the business that you are getting yourself into is something of value and not a trap set up to make money from you instead of you gaining.

<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">5) Luxury </h4>
Poor People like spending or payment whiles the rich focus on profit. They will buy the  new fancy girl in town just to impress their nabours who  earns the same amount of money every month with them, they don’t mind they will spend almost their totally earning of the past month on buying luxury items without thinking of investment of paying for their own bills, so they stay poor and remain in one position forever.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">6) feasting </h4>
As soon as they get paid they go out for nice drink, meal and end up spending almost quarter of their paycheck. I will give you quick example.  Most People get paid on Fridays, by 5:00 their out of their job by 6:00 their in the hours and by 7:00 their already settled in the establishment but the time they end up ordering food and drink for  all their friends  they realize they have spent 30% of their paycheck on that single night. Now the problem with this is that you are spending a fraction of your pay check just to feed yourself which will last for a couple of hours but now you need 3 weeks or 4  until you get paid the next time and that can be a tragedy especially when you don’t have no money to spend in the next coming weeks.

<br/>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-family:curasive;">7)  Entertainment </h4>
Poor People fuck up thousands of dollars in entertainment so they can get a little happy or excitement in their life’s.  Look guys am not against entertainment at all but if you are making only $100 a month it is not wealth paying $100 just to catch the championship game league live no you can watch on the   TV for free. <br/>
So see I have given you 7 things poor people do with their money and now you might be asking me so what does rich people do with their money  and this may change your life. 
<br/>
Rich People invest first in themselves  and then in their business or other business that help them to multiply their money, they invest in asset never in liabilities that keep them down from becoming financial independent.
