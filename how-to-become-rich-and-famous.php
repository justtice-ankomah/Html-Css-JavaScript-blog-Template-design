2.	Be The First to Introduce Something New </h3>
<p> Most people fail in life and they will keep failing in life. </p>
<p> Do you know why? </p>
<p> No, can you explain. </p>
<p> It’s because their trying to be the best instead of being the first.  The Bible says “there is nothing new under the sun” This does not mean anything that is newly invented existed somewhere before, no it is a wise parable you do need to think about. Hey, are you a preacher? No, I know only one sentence in the Bible and that is what I just told you. </p>
<p> Be the first person to introduce anything new into the world. Today there are a lot of E-commerce businesses over the internet. But there is one person name that come’s to our mind wherever we heard of such businesses “Jack Ma” If Jack Ma haven’t had introduced E-commerce I don’t think people would have known the need to shop online. But Besides all those small and big E-commerce over the internet who is rich and famous? </p>
<p> Jack ma right? Yes because that is what people know him of. So whenever you hear Jack Ma names you get a picture of E-commerce business in your mind making him so famous. </p>
<p> So be the first to introduce anything new for the world to see. Is true you can become rich in an existing invention but if you want the real fame for it; you have to be the first to introduce it. </p>

<p> Do you know that the best and the simplest way to become rich and famous is to establish friendship with famous people? </p>

If you want to become rich and famous what I will advise you on is to make friends who are already rich and famous in your society. This does not mean you should not make friends with the poor or the needed no. </p>
<p> What I mean here is to friend with someone that you can learn from him. Haven’t anyone said to you that “We ride in the same boat we took?” if you want to become rich you need to ride in the same boat with rich peoples and the best way to do this is to establish friendship with them and follow their footsteps.  </p>

He being so poor with no good voice what he did was to establish a friendship with one musician. </p>
<p> Do you think is easy for and ordinary poor guy to make friends with a celebrity? No, most of the musicians are not even willing to be your friends in case you are poor. But James made this so simple. He connected with the musician on twitter and he didn’t told him straight that “He want to be his friend” What James said was “I want to make you so famous” Just look at what this poor guy is saying, someone who is dreaming of becoming famous is telling a famous musician that I want to make you so famous. </p>
<p> The musician said ok and said how are you going to do it am losing a lot of fans? </p>
<p> Just watch me, am going to put you to next level by next month if only you will keep replying my messages here. Said by James. The musician said ok I will. What James did was simple, he being a visual art student made a lot of designs on walls and electronic visuals files. He focused only on  two words “Top, Best” On one of his art he said “Nikki is the “Best” must musician we the youth like” </p>
<p> He set this art as his social media profile and shared it on various platforms. There was a lot of comment on all his post and the musician name was everywhere. So he messaged the musician and said hey, who do you think is the cause of all the noise around on your name? The musician said what, you did that? James said yes. </p>
<p> That was the beginning of their friendship. They met and he helped James. Now James the poor guy is very rich and famous due to his network with the musician. </p>

<p> Hey, what are you saying, should I go and get married now? </p>
<p> Yes, if you are ready but remember not just to any guy or lady. Marriage has a lot of advantage and disadvantages so you need to be very careful of whom you should choose. If you don’t choose correctly, you will live the rest of your life unhappily. But if you do it correctly, oh, you will be the most joyful person on this earth.

Just imagine being the husband or the wife of the president son or daughter.  Comment below on how famous you will be. </p>
