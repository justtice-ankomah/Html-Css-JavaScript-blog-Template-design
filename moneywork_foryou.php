   The answer is yes. That is how all the successful people does earn their millions, is only few successful peope that physically involves themself's in the running of their businessess most of them don't, they actually have reqular person's that does runs it for them. With these employess that they have, most of them actually don't understand the law of money and hence does not know how to make your money work for you real meaning.
   <p></p>
   They work for small paycheck, and hence because they don't know anything about money, when they receive their paycheck they spend it any how without thinking about the future, savings, assets. Just imagine you having this kind of mindset towards money. how will your life be incase you lost your job? how will you survive in the comming days since you don't have any asset's that generate income for you or any savings in the bank that you can depend on. 
   <p></p>
   Working for companies for paycheck is'nt a bad thing, most of the successful peopel who are now millonairs started that way.
   <p title="money work for you meaning"></p>
   But the secrete here is. Instead of them depending on their paycheck they think about the future and what they can fall back on incase they are to loose their job, So they convert their paycheck to asssets, business, and investment. They don't spend any how but make sure that  anything that they spend on is something valuable.
